export const radarLoveText = `CHAPTER 1 - Hotel California

The warden’s office was a paradox, a pocket of quiet civility in the heart of a storm. Polished mahogany and the scent of old leather stood in stark defiance to the concrete and despair that defined the rest of the prison. Chris Turner sat opposite the desk, his hands resting loosely in his lap, a stark contrast to the tension that coiled in his gut. He had been a lot of things in his life—a gambler, a romantic, a fool—but he’d never really been free, not even on the outside.

Warden Jacobs cleared his throat, the sound pulling Chris from his reverie. “Turner,” he began, his voice a low rumble, “you’re a hard man to figure out.”

Chris offered a small, noncommittal smile. He’d heard it before.

“You’ve done your time,” Jacobs continued, leaning back in his chair, the leather groaning in protest. “Five years. Clean record inside. You’ve kept your head down. I respect that. But the world outside… it hasn’t been waiting for you.”

The words hung in the air, heavy with the truth he already knew. Chris thought of Janique, her image a faded photograph he’d stared at until the edges frayed. Her letters had stopped a year ago. A lifetime ago. The Eagles were playing softly on a radio somewhere in the outer office, a tinny rendition of ‘Lyin’ Eyes’. The irony was not lost on him.

“I’m aware of that, sir,” Chris said, his voice steady, betraying none of the turmoil inside.

“You’ve proven you can handle yourself, that you can follow a plan. We’re starting a new project. A big one. Building a new block on the west end of the yard. It's a long-term job, and I need men on the crew I can trust not to make things complicated. Men who know this is the only world they’ve got right now.”

The warden paused, letting the offer settle. It wasn't freedom. It was just a different kind of cage, one with blueprints and concrete. But it was something. A purpose. A way to make the days move.

Chris felt a tremor of something he hadn’t allowed himself to feel in years: resolve. It was a solid, heavy thing. He thought of the endless, crawling hours in his cell, of the ghost of a life he couldn't get back. He thought of the last song they’d danced to, another Eagles track, the promise of ‘Take It to the Limit’ echoing in his memory.

“I’ll do it,” Chris said. The words tasted like work and dust, but they were real.

The warden nodded, a flicker of something like approval in his eyes. “I thought you might. Report to Foreman Miller in the morning.”

Chris stood, the cheap fabric of his prison uniform feeling suddenly like a workman's clothes. As he walked out of the office, past the guards and the clanging steel doors, the music from the radio became clearer. It was the opening chords of ‘Hotel California’. A fitting, final paradox. He was checking out of his old routine, but he knew he could never truly leave. Part of him would always be a prisoner here. But for the first time in five years, he had something to build.

CHAPTER 2 - The Rock Yard

The next day, Chris found himself in the rock yard, the morning sun already a hammer blow against the concrete. This was the purgatory between the cell block and the promise of work. Men milled about in listless circles, their conversations low and guttural. A bored-looking correctional officer named Smith watched from his perch on the wall, rifle held loosely across his chest. Chris kept to himself, leaning against a chain-link fence, observing the intricate, invisible lines of power that divided the yard.

It was then he saw him. Tokio Jones. He didn't carry himself like the other inmates. There was no swagger, no loud proclamation of his presence. There was just a stillness, an unnerving calm that seemed to bend the space around him. He sat on a weight bench, not lifting, just watching. Men gave him a wide berth. Even from fifty yards away, Chris could feel the weight of his gaze. It swept across the yard, cataloging everything, missing nothing. For a moment, it landed on Chris, and for that moment, Chris felt like the only other person in the yard. Then it was gone. Tokio had seen him, filed him away. Chris knew, without a single word being exchanged, that this was a man who ran his world from the inside.

CHAPTER 3 - Blueprints and Concrete

Foreman Miller, "Sarge," was a civilian contractor with a face like a roadmap of every bad road he'd ever been down. He was tough, leathery, and had no time for bullshit. "You're Turner," he grunted, not a question. "Jacobs says you're reliable. We'll see." He thrust a hard hat and a pair of worn leather gloves into Chris's hands. "Welcome to the crew."

The construction site was a controlled chaos of rebar skeletons and wooden forms. The air was thick with the smell of wet concrete and diesel. Chris was put on a crew with a handful of other inmates, including a mountain of a man everyone called "Tiny" Gallows. Tiny didn't speak; he communicated in grunts and by moving things that seemed impossibly heavy. The work was brutal, relentless. It stripped away thought, leaving only the ache of muscle and the rhythm of the job. By the end of the first day, Chris was exhausted in a way he hadn't been in years, a clean, physical exhaustion that pushed everything else out.

CHAPTER 4 - The Ghost of You

That night, lying on his bunk, every muscle screaming, the ghost of Janique came to him. It wasn't the faded photograph, but a full, living memory. The smell of sawdust from the construction site had triggered it. A memory of a Saturday afternoon in the garage, helping her father build a bookshelf. Janique was there, her hair tied up, a smudge of wood stain on her cheek, laughing at his clumsy attempts with a hammer. Later that night, they'd driven out to the lake. That was the night he told her his plan, the one-time score that would set them up for life. He remembered the worry in her eyes, the way she'd held his hand and told him he didn't need to do it. The memory soured, shifting to the flashing lights, the cold terror of the arrest. The bookshelf was never finished.

CHAPTER 5 - A Different Kind of Steel

Weeks turned into a month. Chris found his rhythm. He was good at the work, precise. But his quiet competence drew the wrong kind of attention. Spike Rossi, a wiry inmate with a chip on his shoulder, started making comments, trying to push Chris into doing his share of the heavy lifting. Chris ignored him, then pushed back with a quiet "no." The tension simmered until one afternoon, Spike cornered him by the water cooler. "You think you're better than us, college boy?" he snarled, shoving Chris against a stack of plywood.

Before Chris could react, a shadow fell over them. "He's with me," a low voice said. It was Tokio Jones. He hadn't raised his voice, but the effect was instant. Spike froze, the aggression draining from his face. "My mistake, T," he mumbled, backing away. Tokio watched him go, then turned his unnervingly calm eyes on Chris. "Stay out of the static," he said, and walked away, leaving Chris with the sudden, heavy understanding that he had just been claimed.

CHAPTER 6 - Mortar and Lies

Sarge started giving Chris more responsibility, trusting him with the blueprints. "You've got a good eye, Turner," he'd said, a rare compliment. This new standing also got him noticed by Guard Henderson, a man whose smile never quite reached his eyes. Henderson caught him alone on his way back from the site. "A smart guy like you could make things easier for himself," he'd said, his voice slick. He laid out a simple plan: a package dropped in the foundation forms before a pour, retrieved on the other side. Easy. Chris felt a cold dread. He was being squeezed from both sides now, the inmates and the guards.

CHAPTER 7 - Dear John

A letter arrived. Not a new one. Chris kept it, the last one from Janique, in his footlocker. He hadn't read it in months. That night, he took it out. The paper was soft, worn at the creases. Her words were kind but firm. She was moving on. She had to. His sentence was too long, the silence too much. She wished him well. There was a memory of her brother, Marco, getting in his face a week before the robbery. "You stay away from her, Chris. You're poison." He'd been right. Chris folded the letter, the paper a tombstone for a life that was well and truly over. He had to let her go.

CHAPTER 8 - The Accident

The shriek of stressed metal was followed by a sickening thud. A pallet of rebar had "slipped" from a crane lift, crashing down onto the scaffolding where Spike Rossi had been working. It wasn't a direct hit, but it was close enough. Spike lay in a broken heap, screaming. It was chaos. Guards swarmed the site, and Warden Jacobs himself came down to investigate. It was ruled an accident, but nobody believed it. Chris had been looking at the crane operator, another inmate, and he'd seen the man glance towards Tokio just a second before the pallet fell. When Jacobs questioned him, Chris said he hadn't seen a thing.

CHAPTER 9 - The Price of Silence

A few nights later, Tokio sat down next to him in the mess hall. "Spike was a problem," he said quietly, stirring his watery soup. "He was talking to Henderson. Bad for business." He looked at Chris. "You've got good eyes. You see things. But you know when not to see them. I appreciate that." It wasn't a threat; it was an induction. Chris was in. A few days later, Henderson cornered him again, more insistent this time. "The next pour is Friday. Don't disappoint me." The vise was tightening.

CHAPTER 10 - Raising the Walls

Chris spent hours staring at the blueprints, his mind racing. He couldn't go to the Warden. He couldn't say no to Tokio's protection. And he couldn't work for Henderson. Then he saw it. A detail in the plumbing schematics. A drainpipe that was scheduled to be installed *after* the foundation pour. On Friday, as the concrete began to flow, Chris "tripped" near the forms, knocking a discarded piece of scaffolding into the flow. It was just enough to divert a small stream of concrete down the open drainpipe, clogging it solid. Henderson's hiding spot was filled with three tons of hardening cement. Sarge yelled at him for the screw-up, but later, as they were packing up, the old foreman caught his eye and gave him a slow, almost imperceptible nod.

CHAPTER 11 - A New Foundation

The dynamics on the crew changed. Henderson stopped bothering him. The other inmates treated him with a new respect. He wasn't one of them, not really, but he wasn't a target anymore either. He was his own man. One sweltering afternoon, Tiny Gallows, who had never said more than two words to him, silently offered him his canteen. Chris took a long drink. It was a small thing, but it was everything. Warden Jacobs officially closed the investigation into the "accident," citing equipment failure. The walls of the new block kept rising.

CHAPTER 12 - The Long Road Home

Months later, the new cell block stood almost complete, a monument of grey concrete against a pale sky. Chris stood in the yard, looking at it. The dust, the sweat, the sheer weight of it—he had helped build that. It was a permanent part of this place, and a part of him. He was no longer the man who dreamed of Janique and a life outside. He was the man who laid foundations, who read blueprints, who understood the silent language of the yard. Across the way, he saw Tokio Jones leaning against the wall, watching him. Their eyes met. Tokio gave a single, slow nod of understanding. Chris nodded back. They were two kings in a kingdom of cages, each having built his own world inside the walls. For the first time in a long time, Chris felt a sense of peace. He had a purpose. He had a place. This was home now.`;
