The warden’s office was a paradox, a pocket of quiet civility in the heart of a storm. Polished mahogany and the scent of old leather stood in stark defiance to the concrete and despair that defined the rest of the prison. Chris Turner sat opposite the desk, his hands resting loosely in his lap, a stark contrast to the tension that coiled in his gut. He had been a lot of things in his life—a gambler, a romantic, a fool—but he’d never been a mechanic. That was a life that belonged to someone else, a life he’d built in his mind to pass the endless, crawling hours.

Warden Jacobs cleared his throat, the sound pulling Chris from his reverie. “Turner,” he began, his voice a low rumble, “you’re a hard man to figure out.”

Chris offered a small, noncommittal smile. He’d heard it before.

“You’ve done your time,” Jacobs continued, leaning back in his chair, the leather groaning in protest. “Five years. Clean record inside. You’ve kept your head down. I respect that. But the world outside… it hasn’t been waiting for you.”

The words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken meaning. Chris thought of Janique, her image a faded photograph he’d stared at until the edges frayed. Her letters had stopped a year ago. A lifetime ago. The Eagles were playing softly on a radio somewhere in the outer office, a tinny rendition of ‘Lyin’ Eyes’. The irony was not lost on him.

“I’m aware of that, sir,” Chris said, his voice steady, betraying none of the turmoil inside.

“Your file says you were a mechanic. Top of your game. Specialized in high-performance imports,” Jacobs said, peering at a folder on his desk.

Chris didn’t correct him. The lie had been born of a drunken night of bravado years before his sentence, a story spun to impress a girl whose name he couldn’t remember. It had taken on a life of its own, a fiction he’d polished until it shone brighter than the truth. The truth was just grease and busted knuckles in a forgotten garage. This lie was fast cars and open roads.

“I’ve got an opportunity for you,” the warden said, closing the file. “A second chance. A friend of mine runs a high-end garage. Needs someone with your… particular skills. It’s a clean slate, Turner. A long way from here. But you start tomorrow.”

Chris felt a tremor of something he hadn’t allowed himself to feel in years: hope. It was a dangerous, fragile thing. He thought of the open road, of the possibility of a new life, of maybe, just maybe, finding his way back to Janique. He thought of the last song they’d danced to, another Eagles track, the promise of ‘Take It to the Limit’ echoing in his memory.

“I’ll take it,” Chris said. The words tasted like freedom.

The warden nodded, a flicker of something like a smile on his lips. “I thought you might. Your ride is waiting.”

Chris stood, the cheap fabric of his release clothes feeling foreign and stiff. As he walked out of the office, past the guards and the clanging steel doors, the music from the radio became clearer. It was the opening chords of ‘Hotel California’. A fitting, final paradox. He was checking out, but he knew he could never truly leave. Part of him would always be a prisoner here, haunted by the ghosts of what might have been. But for the first time in five years, the road ahead was his to drive.`;
