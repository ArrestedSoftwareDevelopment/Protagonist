When I first met Mr. Tokio Jones, I was immersed in research for my book detailing the life and times of Chris and Janique Turner. But he proved to be an exceptional figure in his own right, with a story that fascinated me. I knew I had to tell his tale as well, one filled with drama and hyperbole. We were of different worlds, now occupying some unlikely intersection of the two. I did my best to leave things in their rawest form, and to not color the text via the lens of my own upbringing. In some respects, I feel I have succeeded. In other ways, this work is but a thumbnail sketch of a complex and admirable individual.
Over time, the little notes we made for each other in the draft became such a part of the flavor of the story, I ultimately decided to leave them in. An unconventional format for the tale of an unconventional man. I think that is somehow both fitting and poetic.
