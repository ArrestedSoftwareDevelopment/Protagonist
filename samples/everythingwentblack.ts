My motherfuckin’ name is Tokio. At least it was. Clarence James Jackson, since you get to know the real me. We might as well start there. I’m a motherfuckin’ pimp. That is to say, I used to be, could be, and thus, still am. Be that as it may. You cannot take that title from me, nor disparage what I did. But that’s what it was. This is what it is now.

So, there I was. Little twelve-year-old Clarence. Wide-eyed. Positive. Thrilled with the world. Happy-go-lucky-ass. Good grades. B’s, you know. You don’t want to be too square. You’re taught that, somehow. Not just in school. To me, it likely comes about with each generation being smarter than the last, evolutionarily, and via media amplification. When the child is shown to be smarter than the parent, gaslighting begins. But this is starting to sound like some fuckin’ pity party. Shit ain’t like that.`;
