Chapter 1 - Overboard
      Captain Dan stood at the rails of his ship, surveying the choppy waters. He steadied himself with a single white-knuckled hand and strained the limits of his binoculars.

      "Sir, we're just about out of fuel. We don't have enough to make another pass and get to port before she hits, sir," Yeoman Clancy pointed out, in accordance to his duties.

      "Yeoman," the captain said through gritted teeth, never taking the binoculars from his eyes. "If you don't shut up with your nonsense concerns, I am going to throw you overboard."

      Clancy imperceptibly nodded to a man who wasn't looking, and dismissed himself in silence. His own reaction gave the captain pause. He wasn't known as "The Highest High-C on the Bloody High-Seas" for nothing. Whatever they actually meant by it. He knew his crew loved him like no other, harsh taskmaster or not.

Still, all this for a stowaway?

      Twenty minutes later, Clancy returned. An observant captain would have noticed the liquid courage on his breath, steeling himself with alcohol as he did to gain the confidence for another confrontation with his mentor. The world had forced Dan to relocate permanently to the ocean in order to save a shred of his fading humanity. It always came to this, in the student-teacher relationship.

      "Sir, we c-ngh," Clancy emitted, as Captain Dan's left hand raised up silently and backhanded him into unconsciousness.

      He saw...something, out there, in her. Her being the sea. Everything was a she when you lived on the ocean with a bunch of hard legs. But he knew his feelings. He trusted them above all. His instincts made him who his was. And he was the best rogue pilot the NAU Navy could afford.

      He radioed the contower. "Kill the engines, and drop some boats," he said. "I want everyone awake, in these boats, rowing and searching until we find her again. Now," he gritted. "Move!"

      Thirteen tired, angry men stirred. Had they a little less respect, he would have been the next one in the ocean. But he saw something out there. His imagination? No. That point, that slightly discolored portion of water too far ahead to be sure it really was a speck of a different color, represented his salvation. He had lost crewmen and passengers before, but he wasn't losing this one without a fight.

      "Radio for a tanker to rendezvous at 0600," he snapped into the radio. "We're going to be here the rest of the night, until we find her."

      Thousands of feet away, held aloft by pure human will, a frail, scared, nearly unconscious young lady with a rebellious streak as wide as the Mississippi called out with the last of her strength, "Help..."

No one heard her.

� � �

      Regina Long bobbed along in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic, clinging to both a life preserver and her life. They were, at this point, indistinguishable. To let go was to sink into the icy black waters. And oh, how she wanted to let go.

      She could no longer feel her arms, and her legs lacked the strength to kick. Her eyes were unfocused for longer and longer intervals. Now so dehydrated she could no longer cry, Regina was losing the will to live.

      Tagging along on some quasi-military research mission seemed like a good idea at the time. And she did have the foresight to come equipped. Her thermal wetsuit kept her warm enough, for the first few hours. But one foot was ripped off. The pain and numbness slowly crept up her arch to her calf before she really noticed.

      Now her body temperature was lowered and she was entering the hypothermia zone. So blind, frozen, crippled and mentally exhausted, the remaining span of her time on Earth could be measured in minutes. The last of her strength was used to meekly call out for help one last time.

      She tried to focus her eyes, even though she now lacked the ability to rotate her field of vision, and thought she saw a flash. It ignited a spark in her mind, rejuvenating her interest in survival, if only for a little while longer.

      Regina knew that in due time, she would cease to care at all. Her death would be horrible, but she planned to sleep through it. All she had to do was close her eyes. She attempted to move for the first time in hours, and felt the blood flow return in full force. She was amazed to discover that she had feeling in her legs again. She knew this because something brushed against her foot. Something sandpapery.

� � �

      Captain Dan's inflatable boat was the last to hit the water, and the first to reach the area, just in time to see Regina let go, relinquishing her life to forces beyond her control. He dove in after her, fully prepared to swim thirty or forty feet to retrieve her. Had he known about the mako, he would have been better prepared for what lie in store. But she hadn't fallen far, and she didn't appear to be struggling. He grasped the back of her collar and began to kick them upward.

      As they were nearing the surface, the sea around them began roiling. A gigantic shape rose from beneath them. Dan's feet struck something solid below him and he feared the worst.

      What happened next was worse than the worst. They found themselves on the deck of a rising submarine, partially encaged by the railings. Water rolled off the thirty-eight foot wide metallic gunship.

      Before this stunning turn of events could fully register in the minds of those involved, a coffin-sized hatch opened up a few feet away. A nondescript fellow was pointing a gun at them. A second nondescript fellow, a twin of the first, climbed up onto the deck. Captain Dan made a mental note to always bring weapons on rescue missions. The clone took the girl, who was now beginning to cough up seawater, without incident.

      The hatched closed again, and the ship began to dive. Dan leapt off of the side closest to an inflatable before the sub took him down with it. Two of his crewmen pulled him into the raft, and there he sat, panting and stunned.

The President's daughter had been kidnapped.

� � �

      Regina awakened from a wet dream. More of a watery nightmare, actually. Her eyes first focused on the stranger who stood partially astride her prone body. She then did what any red-blooded American woman would do in that situation, she

kicked him in the crotch. His face remained impassive. In fact, he never moved an inch, or gave any indication he had been struck.

"I got nothin'."

      "You have to admit that was impressive, Ms. Long." A voice said from behind her.

      However, Regina did not turn around immediately. She was transfixed at the tableau before her.

      She lay in front of a roaring fireplace on a polar bear skin rug, in what seemed to be a stately English hunting lodge. Pleasant waves of heat radiated out from the fire and washed over her still-shivering body. The walls were adorned with various mounted trophies: elk, lion, moose. Above the mantle was the centerpiece, an antique elephant gun like something out of a steampunk cartoon.

      The cognitive dissonance washed over her in waves. She knew she had been drowning a short time earlier. Or, she thought she had, at least. Now she wasn't so sure. At once, the room became bare. The walls, ceiling and floor were stark and white. The figure looming over her receded and disappeared from the room, although she could detect no door. Regina was already looking for an escape route.

      "You may think his non-reaction indicative of training akin to that the Shaolin monks receive, or perhaps the Sumo practice of 'tucking'. I assure you the answer is a good deal more esoteric. They are bred without sex organs," the voice said.

      She had at this point propped up on her elbows and turned to face her captor, wincing due to the soreness in her joints.

"Do you mean..." she began to ask.

      "Correct. He's as smooth as a Ken doll, as they say. Of course, the bits necessary for hormonal development remain intact, but internalized."

"And why are you telling me this?"

      "My dear, what sort of evil genius would I be if I didn't detail my master plan for you?"

"So you're some sort of super villain?"

      "Not really, the truth is much more mundane, I'm afraid. I'll explain all in good time. I only let you know so you can be assured of your virtue remaining intact. None of my crew will express the slightest interest in you."

"That's really the least of my problems," she said.

      "Indeed. The room you're in, I must say, is far more impressive than humdrum workaday genetic manipulation. The walls and floor are marvels of modern haptics. They can reproduce solid textures ranging from steel and concrete to the bearskin rug you slept on. The visuals are opaque holograms, although I do have an object printer that can reproduce any solid model up to three meters square."

"So you built a Holodeck? You really are an evil genius."

      "Thank you. I think. I'm not convinced I'm evil, although you certainly may feel that way. With good reason. I'd like you to make a phone call for me, Regina."

"Oh, really? To whom?" "Why, your father, of course."
Out of habit, she touched her left wrist.

      "Yes, that. A rather crudely concealed homing device housed in a stylish diving watch. Not that it will do much good on this ship, at any rate. We're in a Faraday cage designed to quell any aberrant signals."

"What are you after, Mr..."

"You may call me Moriarty. Captain Nemo, if you wish. Slartibartfast, even.
My name is not important." "You look like a Tom." "Tom it is, then."
"What are you after, Tom?"

      "My dear Regina, I should think that would be obvious. I want your father to resign. Step down. Abdicate the throne, if you will. If he doesn't, he'll never see you again.



Chapter 2 - National Insecurity
      Back at the ship, a still shaken Captain Dan checked in with the sailing Dutchman Hans "Filthy" Luker, his communications officer and all-around right hand man.

"What's the haps, Filth?"

"Boss, I think we might be in trouble, here." "Ya' think?"
"The President would like to speak with you ASAP, for starters."

      "I'm not here yet. Give me ten minutes. Did you plot an intercept?" He knew in advance it was a futile effort.

      "Of course. We have a rough projection as to where they're headed, but that assumes they maintain their present course and speed. A foolish assumption, at best."

      "Roger that. I think it's safe to say that's the only direction they won't be heading. Christ, Filthy. How do we get roped into these situations? Our charter clearly states that we're a research vessel."

"Some men are born into greatness..." Hans began. "And we have greatness thrust into us," Dan finished.

      The North American Union president sat alone in the Oval Office, numbly waiting for the phone to ring. He had an army of aides and advisors, but he considered this a personal matter, above and beyond the national security aspect. Plus, he no longer knew who to trust.

Regina was his only daughter, and his only child. In fact, she was his only immediate family member. And she was missing. He was beside himself with grief and fear.

Robert "Lazarus" Long's unmarried status was actually one of the less notable aspects of his presidency. The fact that he was the first Libertarian elected to high office was probably the most significant. Even he had been unprepared for the massive social upheaval that had entailed.

      He was elected on a groundswell of popular support, and he'd done great things, having already brought the Union back from the brink of dissolution. Now, he knew it would never be worth this terrible price. If he didn't have a job to do, he'd probably be drinking.

      The North American Union had been formed after the second economic collapse of the United States, and there had been a brief respite from the constant boom and bust cycle that had previously plagued that hemisphere.

      But less than a decade later, things were once again beginning to go bad. So the elite who decided the outcome of all elections of significance backed him as their candidate.

      The idea was that he was going to generally give freedom and the free market lip service to gain office, and perhaps make a few token gestures. But that was never his intention. He would never betray his principles. Although he did have to do a lot of lying to his backers.

      The problem was that their campaign was too successful. The result was a true populist landslide, as the citizens voted overwhelmingly in favor of Robert Long and the values he represented. They couldn't just kill him. He knew the turmoil he was currently embroiled in was yet another attempt to dissuade him from moving forward. It was a compelling argument in their favor.

      He knew it was probably his proposal to dissolve the legal fiction that granted corporations the rights of humans that prompted this latest move. Corporate charters existed at the benevolence of the state, and could be revoked. But he wanted a more lasting legacy. Or at least he used to.

      His backers had foolishly assumed his adherence to free market approach to economic problems meant businesses could run roughshod over the individual. Much to their consternation, he considered industry to be the actions of individuals, and that they should be held responsible for their company's policies and practices.

      Some of his policies were enacted relatively easily. Eliminating victimless crime at the federal level had lowered the crime rate across the entire union, and eased the strain on the beleaguered budgets of many states. Individual states, cities and provinces followed suit. This action, and the support he received for it, cemented his position in the minds of the voters. Whenever the House and Senate opposed his legislation, which was often, he simply brought his case to the people, and they applied pressure to their representatives.

      He was no fan of democracy, but in his case it actually worked. Moral leadership combined with an informed populace could move mountains. Now he was proposing phasing out entitlements, and reducing or eliminating most taxes. It was a hard sell, but he thought he was turning the corner on that one. He could count on the self-interest of men in the drive to eliminate taxes. The most difficult aspect was convincing the women of three different cultures to cast off the imagined safety net of the welfare state.

The phone rang.



Chapter 3 - Paperclips and Butterflies
      "Mr. President," Captain Dan began, "Dan Nolan. First-time caller, longtime fan. How are you, sir?"

      The President dispensed with formalities. "Not too gosh-darned good, Dan. I trust you're aware of the gravity of the situation?"

"I am."

      "I want my daughter back, at all costs. Ideals be damned. Kill people if you have to."

"That's not really my style, sir, but I understand the sentiment." "Can you get her back?"
"I don't like to make promises, Mr. President, but I'll do my best."

      "We need to talk in person, as I have additional information that will aid you. But I no longer trust these phone lines."

"Sir?"

      "I don't want to sound paranoid, but there are no avenues of electronic communication that can be considered secure."

      "Interesting. Well, I'm north of Iceland, currently. I can turn around after I refuel, or radio for a chopper, but I think we're losing valuable time."

"Agreed. Maintain your current position and I'll be there within three
hours."

"Sir?"

      "You'll just have to trust me on this one, like I'm trusting you. Your uncle said you were the best, and his words carry weight with me."

"Thank you, sir. I'll do my best, as I said."

"That's all I ask. Three hours."

� � �

      Two hours and fifty minutes later, as the crew prepared for the President's arrival, Filthy's eyes happened upon two orange dots high overhead.

He called for Dan on the radio.

      "Sir, if we had any anti-air guns, I'd suggest we man them now. We have company. This is Hans," he added needlessly.

      He had come to accept his nickname, but he never referred to himself as such. Although he appreciated the wordplay and humor behind it, Hans would never be 'Filthy' in his mind. He was far too fastidious. Without replying, Captain Dan rushed topside to find his first mate staring through his binoculars, transfixed at the two blossoming shapes overhead.

"Whatcha got, Filthy?" he asked. "Trouble?"

"Sir, we appear to be undergoing an invasion by two old men."

      Two minutes ahead of the scheduled rendezvous time, the President and his traveling companion touched down on the deck of the Mary Celeste II.

� � �

"I suppose if I don't call, you'll kill me?" Regina asked.

"Kill you? Heavens no! Life's too precious to be wasted, dear Regina.
Besides, there are fates worse than death..." "Such as?"
"How would you like to be a clone, for instance?" "Not very much, I suspect."
"Not at all, really. They're partially lobotomized." "Zombies..." Regina said.

"Aren't we all, really? I could make you a Monarch." "Like, a queen?"
      "More like a butterfly. We used to call them Presidential models, but your father put an end to that bit of fun."

"A Presidential model butterfly. I'm gonna need more info."

      "Do I really have to crassly spell things out? You've led a sheltered life, I realize. Project Monarch was an offshoot of MK-Ultra, which was a natural outgrowth of Operation Paperclip."

      "Ooh, paperclips and butterflies. Truly an evil force to be reckoned with," Regina mocked.

      "Paperclip, dear Regina, was the U.S. Government's program to import Nazi scientists and their research, following World War Two."

"Wait, I have heard of that. It's where we got NASA, right?"

      "Correct. More to the point, it is where we began the program of creating undetectable mind-controlled slaves."

"Yeah, right."

      "It is all quite true, I assure you. Given a little time, I could easily program you to kill your own father, and then yourself. Were I so inclined, of course. Demerol, a darkened room, some electrodes and thou, I think the poet said."

"You sick bastard. I'd never kill my father."

      "You'd have no choice, Regina. In your mind, you'd be someone else entirely. See, for example, Mark David Chapman or Sirhan Sirhan. Neither man had any recollection of what they'd done, because when they pulled the trigger, they were someone else."

"And these guys were Monarchs?" she asked.

      "No. Your assassin class is Delta. As in Delta Force, or delta meaning change. Monarchs are technically Betas. Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta," he continued. "Alphas are general use subjects, useful for espionage, deep-cover and infiltration purposes. The perfect spies, because they aren't conscious of what they're doing, or what they know."

      Tom beamed proudly. "Betas are used for lots of grey area work. Sex and drugs, primarily. Seduction, pornography, smuggling, prostitution. Compromising others is a tool of the trade. It's generally more effective than violence."

"So why Presidential model?"

      "My dear, powerful men simply cannot cavort with common sex workers, plebeians and the like. The potential for mishaps and blackmail is too great. Instead, we kept a stable of puppets, male and female, for our most valued clients."

"Disgusting."

      "It's not all bad, Regina. They're well cared for. Perhaps you've heard of Annette Funicello?"

She stared at him blankly.

"Oh, right. Sorry. How about Britney Spears, then?" "You're kidding."
      "Not in the least. You may be too young to remember her in her heyday, but she had a rather public breakdown. It happens when the programming isn't periodically reinforced. Sometimes they grow too rich and elude their handlers."

"Who else?"

"Marilyn Monroe. Surely you've heard of her. Britney's contemporaries as
well."

      Regina thought back and then it dawned on her. "Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake?"

"Yes, the very same. All graduates of the Mickey Mouse Club, so to speak."

She was repulsed and fascinated at the same time. "Was the guy who shot Kennedy a delta?"
      "No, a useful idiot, at best, if you're referring to Oswald. He was a bit brainwashed and lied to, but he never fired a shot. In fact, there's footage of him watching the motorcade pass by. But that is ancient history, dear Regina."

"Do you have to call me that? It's kinda creepy, coming from you."

"Please forgive me... Regina. My social skills appear to have atrophied.
Now then, would you like to speak to your father?"

"I guess. But I'm not going to say what you want me to say."

"The content of the conversation is irrelevant. He will get the message." "Then let's get this over with," she said.
      No sooner had Regina spoken these words when she heard a ringtone, and then her father's voice say, "Hello?"



Chapter 4 - First Impressions
"Mr. President!"

Dan was extending his arm to shake hands when a cell phone rang. "Sorry Dan, gotta take this. Kinda important."
"Dad?"

"Regina Anne Marie, you are in a world of trouble. Are you okay?"

      She felt a pang in her heart. Her mother used to call her that when she was a child, spilling sugarbowls and jumping into mud puddles.

"I'm okay, Dad. Or, I'm not hurt, at least." "That's a relief. Where are you? Who has you?"
      "I'm not really sure, in both cases. Although if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say under the sea, held prisoner by," she glanced behind her, "Gandalf the White. He's mostly harmless," she said, continuing the theme Tom had established earlier.

He smiled and gave her an enthusiastic thumbs-up in response. "What does he want?"
      "He says he represents the men who rule the world, and that they'd very much like for you to step down."

"Tell him I'll do it!" he said immediately.

      "Don't worry, Dad. He's not going to kill me," she said, shuddering involuntarily at what he might do instead. "Don't do it."

      "Now tell him that he will never see you again. We have to go," Tom whispered in her ear.

"I have to go for now, dad. But please don't give in. I'll see you soon,
okay?"

"Regina, tell him I'll resign tonight."

"Bye. Love you," she managed to get out before the connection was broken.

� � �

      While this conversation was occurring, Dan was lost in reverie. It was still unreal to think that the young lady he had so recently met was gone, particularly considering the circumstances of her departure.

      It seemed like it was only a day ago. It had been three days, in fact. After a busy first day at sea, having departed Montauk, New York, he had finally succumbed to exhaustion and stumbled, bleary-eyed, into his cabin.

      When he switched on the lights, a figure sat bolt upright in his bed and said, "What the hell? I'm trying to sleep!"

      It was a girl, and a young one, by appearance. She was wearing both his Florida Dolphins jersey and the eye mask he used to block out the light from the instrument panel when he slept. On the floor was a damp insulated scuba diver's suit.

      "You should have turned on the white noise generator," he said. "You'd sleep better with it."

      Regina remembered where she was. She raised one corner of the eye patch and saw Captain Dan looking at her, arms crossed. He didn't seem particularly vexed, however, and she proffered a weak smile.

      "Breakfast is at 0500," he said, punching a few buttons on the keypad next to the light switch.

      Dan set the alarm for 0450, turned on the white noise, turned off the lights and exited, closing the door behind him. Lucy would have some serious 'splainin' to do in the morning, but she was clearly no threat. At least not in the traditional sense.

      Besides, he was dog-tired. He grabbed a sleeping bag and pillows, and grumbled indignantly as he set up his pallet on the storeroom floor.

� � �

      The next morning, Dan returned to find her sitting primly on the foot of the bed, fully dressed and applying mascara. She dropped the mirror, also his, and batted her lashes at him twice.

"What do you think?" she asked.

      "I don't think you need make-up," he said. "And you seem to have some real issues with privacy and property."

      She was lithe and trim, with long, straight brown hair. He tried to make out the color of her eyes and realized he was staring.

      "Oh, spare me the party line, comrade," she said. "I'm so sick of libertarian rhetoric. Besides, I'm pretty sure you don't need make-up, either, but you have some, just the same. It's really none of my business, is it?"

      "It belongs to a former guest," he began. Dan suddenly had an overwhelming urge to explain and defend himself.

      "Whatever, dude. Blue eye shadow isn't right for you, anyhow. You're a summer." She giggled at this.

"Well, I see you found the pants. Are you hungry?" "I am fully, famously, fabulously famished."
      "Let's go to the galley." As an afterthought, he said, "Oh, one more thing, really quickly. Under the power of the North American Union Navy, I hereby place you under arrest for the crimes of breaking and entering, and trespassing. It's really a formality, though. I'm not going to handcuff you."

"Too bad," Regina said. "That's hot."



Chapter 5 - Yum
      Dan walked her over to the table, seated her, and then retrieved a steaming carafe of java and cups. He poured each of them a mug, and watched with amusement as she gulped down both of them, one after another.

"I'm sorry," she said, "did you want some?"

"Later. I have to cook. How do you like your omelets? Rabbit food, or whole
hog?"

      "Ooh, that's a toughie. Better give me the veggie one." She paused. "And maybe a tiny slice of bacon."

      Dan nodded, and began to assemble the ingredients. He broke three eggs, then glanced back at his captive and broke two more. She was thin, but tall. And she probably hadn't eaten in the past eighteen hours.

      Into the pan went the eggs, followed by a rainbow of red and green bell pepper, caramelized yellow onions, diced brown shiitake mushrooms and light green banana peppers. Finally, he added a splash of jalape�o juice. While the pan steamed and sputtered, he brought tall glasses of milk and orange juice.

"This is better than Denny's," she quipped.

      Dan then added thin strips of provolone, folded the eggs over the vegetables, and topped his creation with two crisp slices of bacon. He sat and sipped his coffee while she proceeded to devour everything in sight.

"More?" he asked when she had finished. "Braap," she belched. "I mean, no, thank you."
"Okay," he said, "Who the hell are you, and why are you on my ship?"

      "Honeymoon's over, eh? My name's Regina Long, and I'm running away from home."

"Do you know that's the name of the President's daughter?" he asked.

"Is it? How utterly charming."

"Yeah. Next time you invent a fake name, put a little more effort into it, will
you?"

"I will indeed," she said.

      "And aren't you a little old to run away from home?" Dan had her pegged at around twenty.

      "I'm sixteen, guy. That's a respectable age for a runaway. Old enough to know better, young enough to not care."

      Blushing slightly, Dan felt every bit of his forty-three years. "Why'd you run away?" he asked her.

"Mom's dead. Dad works all the time. I got bored."

      "So you snuck onto a secret military base and stowed away on a Navy research vessel?"

      "Oh, please. Montauk's no secret. The Philadelphia Experiment was conducted there."

      "That was a hoax," Dan said. "Time travel isn't possible. Mass teleportation may happen someday, but I can tell you we can't do it now."

      "How do you know time travel isn't possible? There are stranger things on Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, Iago," she said.

"Because there's no such thing as time, Gina."

"Ray-gina," she intoned. "Get it right. Like the Sugarcubes song." "What?" he asked.
      "The Sugarcubes? Anyone? Bjork? Iceland's greatest national treasure? My dad was a huge fan."

"Sorry, I'm not conversant in Icelandic punk bands."

      "Clearly! They were avant-garde pop, not punk. Post-punk. But isn't everything?"

      "Anyway, as I was saying, there is no such thing as time. Time is just a device we use to measure entropy."

"Entropy?"

"The ongoing decay of the universe." "Ah..." she said.
      "Stephen Hawking explained it best. Knock a teacup off of a table, and it shatters. That's entropy. For that teacup, it's a one-way street. No matter how long you wait, it will never reassemble itself and leap back onto the table. Ergo, time travel isn't possible. Q.E.D., H.T.H, H.A.N.D."

      "You're really dating yourself with that archaic troll jargon," she said. "What about faster than light speed?"

      "Oh, please. Einstein's been, well, not discredited, but we know a lot more than we did back then. And that scenario was just for illustrative purposes. If you did travel faster than light, time would just catch up with you when you stopped moving. Cryogenics can approximate forward time travel, but that's the best we can do. So far, anyway."

"I know Albert Einstein," Regina said.

      "Changing the subject, how on Earth did you get on board? That's a top security seaport."

      "Oh, I have my ways. Jedi mind tricks. A hacked TWIC card. Feminine wiles. If you put me on an island, penniless, with a hundred men, I'd own everything a year later. Well, me and seven gay guys, I guess. Man's Achilles' heel is definitely not located on the foot."

"We're not all that easy," he said. "You are," was her response.



Chapter 6 - Meet Albert Einstein
"...olan...NOLAN!" the President shouted, losing his ordinary patience.

      Captain Dan was pulled away from his recent memories, back to the current reality. He had a job to do. The President was still folding up his phone while his silent partner stood at parade rest, gnawing on a stogie.

"Sorry, sir. Just thinking about the case."

"I said, 'Do you have any pertinent info, Nolan?'"

      "Sir, we plotted their course, but it doesn't seem to lead anywhere. I'm afraid we're out of our league, here."

      "Not any more," the President said, and gestured behind him with his thumb. "Meet Albert Einstein, my secret weapon."

      Dan eyed the Earnest Borgnine-looking figure with some skepticism, and not just because of his absurd moniker. Squat, white-haired, with a boxer's nose, he looked like the ornery type that would rather fight than argue. Dan's eyebrow rose and the old man grunted.

      "I've known Al here since college, and no, I won't put a date on that. But he's reliable, dedicated, and smarter than a hundred PhDs. He's the one that stole the fighter jet for me, didn't you, Al?"

Al emitted another noncommittal grunt.

      "Funny thing is, he's related to Albert Einstein. But when Al's family moved to this country, they felt 'Einstein' was a little too ethnic. So his real name is Albert Onestone. We just call him Al. Now Al's a for-real certified genius. Tell 'em what your cousin got wrong regarding relativity, Al," the President demanded.

"Forgot to carry a one," Al replied.

      "He forgot to carry a one! Sixty years of 'dark matter' and 'dark energy' as scientists sought to rectify the real and the theoretical. They should have just double-checked his math. Isn't that something?"

Dan nodded silently.

"Heck, Al here invented the Tesla death ray."

"Sir, didn't Tesla invent the Tesla death ray?" Dan asked naively.

      "No, he never finished it," President Long said. "Al took the concept and made it work. Shrunk and ruggedized it. Super scalar energy technology. Of course, it's almost too powerful to use as a weapon."

"I'm afraid that's not my area of expertise, sir."

"You'd better learn quick, Dan. This is serious business." Dan shook his head in the affirmative.
      "We brought along a few toys," the President said. "Is there a war room where we can recon?"

"There's a breakfast nook with a pretty big table."

      "That'll have to do," the President snapped. "Just leave your quiche and potpourri outside. Take us there."

      Dan was a little taken aback at the forthrightness, which bordered on derision, but it was pretty mild, considering the grave circumstances. He led them to a small room adjacent to the helm.

"Should I get my first mate?" Dan asked. "No time. You can brief him later."
      When the door had closed behind them, the President said, "Let's listen to some music, shall we?"

Dan obliged him by piping in some smooth jazz.

      "Argh, no! Smooth jazz makes me nauseous. Put on some rap or metal," the President said. "Loud."

It was out of character, Dan thought. At any rate, he did as requested.

      "Al says this room is clean. Not bugged, in other words. But someone could still train a laser on a window and decode the vibrations. The music should muddy the waters a bit. Al, show him what you have."

Al began to speak with surprising eloquence. "Your maps are obsolete.
This," he said, "will guide you."

      He placed a clear glass globe on the table. By the look of it, it contained more than one smaller glass globe within it. Al tapped out a sequence on the surface of the glass, and a small portion of it glowed light blue.

"Give me your finger," Al snapped.

      Dan extended his hand, and before he could react, Al had pricked him with a needle, squeezing a drop of Dan's blood onto the glowing spot on the globe.

"Ouch, hey!" Dan said.

At once, it flashed solid and then went clear again.

      "Bite your lip, pantywaist," Al said. "This device will show your position relative to Regina's. It's good to forty thousand feet above or below sea level. Beyond that, you're on your own."

      He handed it to Dan, and at once a single dot glowed and began blinking. Observing the position of the blip in relation to the continents, Dan asked, "This is us, where is she?"

      "Her watch was a decoy, meant to be detected. She has an implant that will broadcast her position. It manufactures nanobots which all share the same quantum state. This allows them to communicate over vast distances, through any medium. What we get in the end is a 3D plot of her travels. But the bots are trapped on the sub with her, currently. When they escape, you'll know where she is.

"What if they don't get out?"

      "Submarines can't stay submerged forever. As soon as the hatch opens, they'll leave a trail we can follow in air or water."

      "Sounds more than useful," Dan said. "But the scale seems like it'd be hard to pinpoint by more than five hundred miles or so."

Al clucked and rolled his eyes. "The scale is relative to the distance, sonny.
Now pay attention."

      He placed an exotic-looking pistol on the table before them. "Tesla death ray," he said simply.

Dan emitted a low whistle.

      "There are actually two settings. The first vaporizes things. The second erases memories. I'd be careful with it."

      Al said nothing for a while. Finally, he produced two sticks of Fruit Stripe gum, red and green, and offered them to him.

"No, thank you."

      "They're explosives, you slaphead. Chew them to activate. Red one first. Apply it to a surface, then chew the green one. When you put them together, you'll have three hundred seconds to get away."

      Dan considered asking why he didn't say five minutes instead of three hundred seconds, and then thought better of it. He'd received more verbal abuse in the past ten minutes than he had in his entire life. Since Al had fallen silent again, the President started to speak, only to be interrupted.

"So what's the plan?" Dan asked.

      "The plan? You have forty-eight hours to get her back before I resign. That's the plan. I don't want to point fingers here, but she was lost on your watch. Now unless you have more questions, I have to address the union tonight. Plus, everyone thinks Al here kidnapped me, so I have to clear his good name as well."

"Questions? Sure, I have a lot of them. How does this stuff work?"

      "It works," Al said. "That's all you need to know. It'd be like explaining trigonometry to an ape."

Unsatisfied by this answer, Dan turned to face President Long.

      "Sorry, you'll have to excuse Al. He was flipping quantum bits when you were still eating Cheerios and watching 'Yo Gabba Gabba'. The way he described it me was that Regina's nanobots are self-organizing in that are programmed to form a communication chain from Regina back to Al's base station. Message transmission occurs at the subatomic level, of course. Not only will they tell us her location, they remember the route she took to get there."

      "But if they all share the same state, in a quantum sense, why can't they communicate now?"

      "A good question. I'm afraid they still need a satellite signal to fix their coordinates. The submarine was something we hadn't planned on."

"They use undetectable, unbreakable encryption," Al added.

      "Yes," the President said, "We learned a lot from the watch design. Al came up with that the first time she ran away from home."

"She's done this before?" Dan asked.

      "Sure. The first time was after I was elected to the Senate. She's given the SS headaches ever since. So Al designed the watch for her. And that worked for a while."

"She ran away when she was six years old?" Dan asked incredulously. "Six? She's almost twenty-seven years old, Dan."
For the fifth time today, Dan felt foolish, and it must have shown on his face. "Let me guess? She told you she was sixteen."
"Right," Dan said.

      "She does that. She said it keeps the men at bay, for the most part. She feels any man stymied by her supposed age probably isn't worthy of her affection in the first place. I'm afraid she doesn't share my era's bias against intergenerational romance."

Dan considered this silently.

      "She was sixteen when her mother passed," the President added. "She and Al have played cat-and-mouse ever since then. He's her godfather, but he's sick about her for another reason, too. Right, Al?"

"They used the signal from the watch to track her," Al said, exasperated.

      Things made a lot more sense for Dan, at that point. One minor mystery solved, at least.

      "So don't feel too bad, Dan. She's been eluding the secret service for years, and she was kidnapped by the world's most powerful criminal consortium. It's not entirely your fault. It is, however, your job to retrieve her."

"Don't screw this up," Al added.

      At the Icelandic port of Sundah�fn in Reykjav�k, they were greeted by a throng of press and well-wishers, as well as what seemed like an entire battalion of Union Marines.

      "This is where we depart, Dan. There's apt to be considerable unrest over the next few days. In fact, I guarantee it. You might want to watch the news tonight, if you can."

"I will, sir."

      His disembarking passengers each shook his hand, and began down the gangway to the wharf.

"Two days," Al said from behind a cigar stub.

� � �

      The room remained silent for a great while after Regina was disconnected from her father.

      "Well, that's done, then." Tom said brightly. "Would you like to walk around, take a nap, eat, anything? We have about two hours before our first stop."

"I guess," she said dejectedly.

"I'll give you access. Place your hand on the wall." Regina complied.
"There," he said. Now you can go anywhere and do almost anything." "And you trust me?"
      "I don't have to. You'll find yourself unable to do anything I don't want you to do. Walk over to the door. Erm, the other wall, rather. A little to your right." He paused. "Now open it."

      Regina stared at the smooth white surface and tried to find a handhold, a depression, anything that would indicate a passageway. Having failed that, she raised her arm to push.

"No, Regina. Use your mind." "What?" she asked.
"Think it open..."

      She hesitated, and then imagined a rectangular opening. Instantly, a portion of the wall disappeared. She stuck her arm through the empty space, amazed. Then Regina retracted her arm and re-imagined the smooth surface again. It was back, as if it had never left. She knocked on it for good measure. Solid.

"How did..." she began.

      "Oh, it's a bunch of subatomic physics I don't really understand. You know what they say about any sufficiently advanced technology and magic, don't you? Indistinguishable. I forget who said that. But we're all made up of mostly empty space and vibrating particles that aren't really there all the time, so I guess it's a parlor trick in the scheme of things."

"Parlor trick? This could change the world!" she exclaimed. "Could? My dear, it has, and for a long time, now."
"How old are you?" she asked.

"I am very old."

"You barely look sixty."

      "I am far older than that, I assure you. However, I have the body of a forty- two old."

"But this technology is incredible! People need to know about it." "What makes you think they deserve it?" Tom asked.
Regina had no answer for this.

"Imagine the wall painted pink," he told her.

      As she did, the wall acquired a dusty rose hue. She stopped thinking about it, and the color remained.

"Oh, yes, they thought of everything," Tom told her. "Who are 'they'?"
      "The priests of the temples of Syrinx, I guess you'd say. Now, make the wall invisible..."

      The wall lost color and grew brighter. Finally, all that could be seen was the corridor and the opposite wall there.

"Amazing!" she half shouted.

"Oh, that's nothing," he said. "Brace yourself."

      At once, Regina felt intense vertigo. Below her was inky blackness. Some sixty or eighty feet above, she could see the sun through the surface of the water. The feeling of motion made her insides tingle. She looked around but was too frightened to move. Tom noticed her discomfort, and the sub reappeared around her.

"Phew!" she said. "That was repo!" "Eh?" Tom said.

"Intense."

      "Yes. There's no good reference point, but we're traveling rather fast. The effect is much better when you can see the seafloor."

"Show me more!" she demanded.

"Hmmm." Tom considered this for a moment. And then he was gone. "Hey!" Regina said involuntarily.
"Behind you," he said. And he was. "Cool!"
"I could have just as easily..."

Regina found herself facing the opposite wall. "...turned you around instead."
      She tried to return the favor, but found she could neither teleport nor move Tom on her own.

"No," he said. "That's an advanced technique you don't have access to yet." "Yet?" she asked. Her heart was aflutter.
"We shall be as gods, I think the book says."

      Regina eventually broached the silence. "Why use a submarine, then? You could just go anywhere."

      "No," he said. "The effectiveness decreases over distance, and little bits of you get left behind. I'm not sure if it's a limitation of the technology or that I'm not adept enough myself."

      "I'm gonna go play," Regina said, without a hint of self-consciousness. She felt like a child again.

"Run along, then. I'll find you when we get there."

"Where are we going?" "Home."



Chapter 7 - Lord Petrus T. Steele
      Eighty-three year old Petrus Steele watched CNN with disgust. He had no love for the media, but lately the propaganda upset his stomach. He was old, but he still had his finger on the pulse of the country. The first few months of President Long's term in office was the typical new president honeymoon. But he noticed that as the year wore on, the newscasters took on a snide, condescending tone that he found extremely distasteful.

      The attitude of the country's elite was in stark contrast to the view of the common man. Steele knew the President's course of action was the only route to security and prosperity, and the man in the street seemed to sense this intuitively.

      The results were inarguable, and so far the anti-Long sentiment expressed in the mass media failed to infect the general population. Petrus, however, didn't need a weatherman, as they say. Things were going to get ugly. He could feel it. Hell, he had planned for it. The President was addressing the nation soon, so he settled into his recliner with a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon.

� � �

      Regina was so engaged was with her newly granted abilities, fears and concerns were forgotten. She walked through the wall without bothering to make it disappear, first.

"Hmm," Tom said. He'd never thought to try that.

      In the hallway, she let her imagination run wild. Vines and ivy grew along the walls ahead of her, and wildflowers sprang up from the floor in full bloom. That made her think of birds, and soon the sub echoed with birdsong. She knew it was all an illusion, but it was an effective and compelling one, nevertheless. After a time, when the sheer novelty had worn away slightly, she had an idea.

      Suddenly, she heard her father's voice say, "Hello?" And then a click as the connection was severed.

"Naughty, naughty," said Tom's disembodied voice.

� � �

      Dan watched his passengers disembark and then sought out Hans. "How long?" was all he asked.

"Forty minutes. Maybe one hour. Refuel, potable water, some supplies."

      Dan knew Filthy was of the Scotty-From-Star-Trek school of thought. Don't tell the captain you'll be done in twenty minutes, even if that's all it will take. He knew he had a solid thirty, no more.

      He started down the wharf toward what he hoped was the center of commerce. Within about ten minutes of speed-walking, Dan had found what he was looking for, a vintage CD store named Burzum. He could have downloaded what he was after in seconds, but he wanted a more visceral, tactile experience.

      He didn't bother with the stoner clerk and instead found the box sets on his own. He scanned through most of them and began to despair. As he was losing hope, he found it. The Sugarcubes complete discography. He made it back with minutes to spare.

      Hans gave him a thumbs-up as he passed, and held up five fingers indicating they would be ready to go in minutes. Perfect. He let himself into his cabin, where he was surprised to still feel Regina's presence.

      Dan thumbed through the discs trying to find a suitable candidate for listening. The second, "Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week," had the song he was really after, "Regina", but he didn't feel the time was right to hear that one. Not while there was still a chance he may never see her again.

      He finally decided to listen to "Hit" from "Stick Around for Joy". Dan vaguely remembered reading that slogan on a Coke machine in Osaka, once. It opened interestingly enough, a pastiche of styles arranged with a hipster air. Brassy keyboards flirted with James Bond and Mission Impossible before giving way to jangling funk guitar. Other than feeling a bit retro, it was decent music. He breathed a sigh of relief.

      Then ing�nue Bjork's voice sauntered out of the speakers as if she was reading his mind:

"This wasn't supposed to happen I was happy, by myself Accidentally, you seduced me

I'm in love...again"

      Captain Dan got goosebumps. He listened to the entire song, restarted it, and listened again. Finally, he switched it off and went to the conn. For the second time that day, he set out to rescue her.

� � �

      Regina began to realize she was in a fabulous, wondrous prison. She dispensed with her playing and began to explore the sub with a new mindset. There were standard-looking berths with beds and closets, a kitchen and dining hall, and a few rooms she found she could not enter by any means. But in none of them did she find any possibility of escape. She never encountered any of the crew.

      The futility of her situation struck her in fullness and she collapsed on a bed, sobbing. She slept a fitful sleep lasting more than an hour. When she awakened, a snatch of lyric entered Regina's head, unbidden:

"I lie on my bed Totally still Eyes wide open I'm in rapture"

      It was a Sugarcubes song from her childhood, a happier time for her. When her parents were still alive. Because in her mind, both her mother and father stopped living years before her mother passed away. They stopped partying, going out, listening to music. They stopped being in love and got serious about life. And so began the slow process of dying.

"Regina Long to the bridge, please."

      Regina stepped outside the sleeping quarters, and realized she wasn't sure how to get back there after her wanderings. Presently, light green footprints appeared on the floor, and she followed them.

"Did you have a good nap?" Tom asked her. "Sure," she said.
"I wanted to show you something."

      She followed him through a series of nondescript corridors to an ornate, wrought-iron spiral staircase.

"Is this real?" she asked.

He rapped the banister with his knuckles. "As real as it gets."

      As they neared the top, a panel opened above them, revealing a bright blue sky. Instantly, a small swarm of ejected nanobots took to the air and sea, and the link to Regina was established. A few clung to the hull of the sub for good measure. A thousand miles away, a second dot began to glow on Al's globe. The game was back on.

      As they emerged onto the deck, Regina suspected that they were at the same spot she was abducted from earlier. Or where she was rescued, she supposed. Both, she ultimately decided. Before them lay a swirling maelstrom that seemed to be hundreds of feet wide. The center was open, and seawater poured in around it like a gigantic circular waterfall.

"What is it?" Regina asked.

"The fabled entrance to the center of the Earth," Tom said solemnly. Regina eyed him with suspicion.
"Okay, just kidding. It's an illusion."

The whirlpool blinked out of existence, replaced with choppy seawater.

      "We still use it from time to time. There's one at the South Pole as well. Admiral Peary wrote of it in his diary. They're decoys essentially. Throw people off the trail, create pointless unsolvable mysteries. Life's no fun without a mystery."

"Peary? That was two hundred years ago." Regina said. "Quite."
      "So when we were using Model-T Fords, you people had technology like this? It's criminal!"

"Is it, Regina? How so?"

"You could improve people's lives!"

"What right do they have to something that's not theirs?" "Um, none, technically."
"And am I somehow obligated to save the world?"

"No, you're not obligated. But you could be the world's savior!" "Do you see what they tend to do to saviors, Regina?"
"If I were you..." she began.
"You shall never be me," he said sharply. Clearly, she had struck a nerve. "People are primarily brutish animals. Apt to misuse gifts such as these. I
have essentially unlimited power, and yet I use it so rarely and sparingly that you would never even know I'm doing it. Only one person at a time can control this system, Regina. I am the eye at the top of the pyramid."

"Who did it before you?" "I don't know."
"Who will have it after you?"

      "Well, funny you should ask. The Oracle, which is essentially an expert system. A knowledge base, if you will. Anyway, the Oracle prescribes that I have an apprentice."

"You don't?"

"I might."

"Who?"

"I'm considering you."

      "My fellow Americans," the President began. It was a clich�, but one he felt strongly about. A master at speaking extemporaneously, he employed no speech writers, used no notes, and would abide no infernal Teleprompters.

      "I bring a message of grave importance to you all. On one hand, things are going great for our union. We are at peace. Crime is down, and the economy continues to gain strength. The pollsters I trust the most tell me many of you are quite happy with the way things are going."

      Don't take these changes for granted. There is a much smaller segment of the population, indeed the world, that is appalled at the freedom and prosperity we are enjoying. They are not foreigners, however, but corporate interests."

      Just before I was to enact legislation to break the stranglehold corporations have on the economy, my daughter was kidnapped."

      Sinister forces are at play. Forces that do not share your best interests. They feel economics is a zero-sum game. That they must profit at your expense. But using your wealth, power and influence to prevent others from prospering isn't capitalism..."

      There was a man you may have heard of by the name of Benito Mussolini. He's considered the father of modern fascism. Mussolini said fascism would be better named 'corporatism', the merger of the state and business interests."

      I realize that many Presidents before me have used this bully pulpit to spread fear, uncertainty and distrust. They spoke of vague, nebulous entities that opposed our way of life, and asked for your trust."

      That makes what I'm about to ask of you that much harder. Because we've all been lied to, many times before. Lied into supporting wars, lied into making needless sacrifices. Lied to. I'm not here to lie to you. All I want is my daughter back. But I'm not also prepared to let the country backslide."

      To that end, I'd like to ask each of you to stand with me in support of my policies. For the next forty-eight hours, stay home from work. Stay home from school. Don't travel. Stay home."

      I don't ask this lightly. Other leaders at this point would probably impose martial law. In this free society we're building together, for the first time in history, I might add, that is not an option."

      The next forty-eight hours promise to be the most tumultuous period in the history of this continent. We are in dangerous times. There will be casualties."

      Don't let them take your freedom, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you and goodnight..."

      The President turned and left the podium, deaf to the shrieking throng of press who jockeyed for his attention.

      Petrus picked up his phone and hit seven on his speed dial. "Get me the goddamn painters," was his only utterance.



Chapter 8 - Revolution
"Hurry up with that primer, worm!" "I gotcha."
      Ferret pulled a bindle of milspec nanothermite from his fanny pack and dumped the contents into the paint bucket. He'd been doing this for over eight years. He really didn't mind the abuse he received as a helper when he considered the importance of the work he was doing. That and the monthly stipend he received, which put him in a tax bracket above the project manager. He would have done it for free, however. It was just that important.

      Across the union, this scenario had been endlessly repeated since union patriots had secretly organized some ten years ago, using only word-of-mouth. But things were coming to a head, he understood. Gramps had said so, and he was never wrong. Besides, it was obvious to all but the most oblivious citizens, at this point.

"Hurry up, worm! We gotta finish this trestle today or you're fired!"

      "I'm done, here you go," he said as he switched the fill line from the empty bucket to the full one. It couldn't come soon enough, he thought.

� � �

      No sooner had they departed the dock, when Hans asked, "What heading, Captain?"

      Dan realized he had no idea. In a flash he ran to his cabin and retrieved the forgotten glass orb from the mantle. There she was. A second dot, red, this time, denoted her location. Helpfully, there were complete latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates displayed as well. He relayed these to Hans over the intercom and they were on their way.

The main problem was that she was a thousand miles away and still moving.
They carried enough fuel for sixteen hundred.

� � �

The mood was somber as Regina and Tom scanned the vista before them.
Eventually Tom said, "Time to go."

      They returned to the interior of the sub and continued toward their destination, now a scant two hundred miles away.

"We'll be there in an hour," Tom said.

      A feeling of desperation crept over Regina. This was really happening. She may never see her father again. She prowled the ship with a new purpose. Eventually, she found a maintenance area that had been previously inaccessible. There were various safety suits hanging neatly side by side, but Regina saw no immediate application for these. What she did find were tools.

      She quickly dug through the toolboxes until she found the pipe wrenches. She swung a few like a batter selecting the perfect game-winning bat, and settled on an eighteen-inch steel one. The twenty-fours were too awkward, and lighter aluminum. She carried it inconspicuously at her side and rushed to where she knew she would find Tom.
Regina crept up behind him and raised the wrench over her right shoulder. "Oh, Regina! You shouldn't have! Flowers, and it's not even my birthday,"
Tom said.

      She lowered her arms and found she that was now holding a bouquet of wilted roses. Her shoulders were sore.

"We're there," Tom said, with no further comment.

      But the top button of her blouse was undone, and it hadn't been before. By her estimate, she had been frozen in place for nearly an hour.

"Where is 'there'?" Regina asked.

"Do you like horror films, Regina?" Tom asked eventually. "Um, no"
"Pity."

      Regina knew the sub had stopped moving, but she was entirely unprepared for what came next. The exterior of the ship vanished as it had before, but now a bank of klieg lights illuminated the dark, crystalline waters.

      The whole of reality seem to blink three times as the lights flashed, plunging everything into brief moments of total darkness. Suddenly an enormous squid, twice as large as the sub itself, was hurtling toward them at a high rate of speed. Regina flinched and braced for impact.

      Just before it struck, it did a one hundred and eighty degree turn and came at them tentacles first, billowing like an umbrella in a high wind. The collision was surprisingly anti-climatic. There was a thud as the gigantic creature enveloped them, and then the walls solidified.

"Oh, our ride's here," Tom said.

      The submarine's exterior returned. A circular hatch began to open in the sub's wall. Stairs descended to the floor, and a small amount of water spilled out.

"What?" Regina asked.

      "Oh, we're not taking the sub directly. Too dangerous. I can't risk anyone discovering my little hideout."

"I'm not getting in the mouth of a giant squid!" "Look inside, Regina."
      She stepped directly in front of the hatch and peered into the cavity. Inside were a single chair, and a table with a book and lamp on it.

"It's a robot?"

"Well, it's technically a cyborg, a living creature that's been modified.
Mainly the chamber you see before you, and some fiddly bits in the brain."

      Tom began to ascend the stairs, and then turned to face her. "Shall we?" he said, extending her his hand.

Having little choice in the matter, Regina took his hand and joined him.

"I'm afraid you'll have to sit on my lap," he said somewhat apologetically.
But there was a faint twinkle in his eyes that made her uncomfortable.

When she was seated, he said, "One more thing. The watch, please." "This? Why? It was a gift from my godfather."
"It's a tracking device, Regina. I can't take any chances."

      A little stunned, she handed it over without further question. A clone appeared, and Tom tossed him the watch. "Put this in a safe place," he said.

"How will I know the time? What time is it now?" she demanded. "There is no time any longer," Tom said.
� � �

      Dan had little choice but to wait. The sub far outclassed his ship, and aside from a brief interlude of about ten minutes when it appeared to stop, it continued to put distance between them.

      What he really should do was sleep, but he couldn't. Instead he drank coffee and paced, growing more and more tense until he felt that he might explode. Thinking about Regina did relax him a bit. He remembered the event that had caused her to abandon ship.

      A few hours after breakfast, a call had come in over the radio: return to the nearest port immediately. Direct order, no reason specified. This wasn't good enough for Dan, of course, so he shook the tree a little higher up. It never occurred to him that he should make the conversation private. Severely reprimanded and chastised for not blindly following orders, he was told to switch to a more secure channel, and then debriefed.

      But Regina Long had undoubtedly eavesdropped, and for reasons known only to her, elected to plunge into a frigid ocean rather than return home. And so here he was.

      Dan remembered the President's speech but it was too late to watch it live. He distracted himself with a replay. There were no protests, riots, anything remarkable going on. Not yet, at least.

� � �

      Ferret had one detonator left to place, and that area of the trestle was barricaded off. Crossing a red barricade, he knew, was a termination offense. But he was going for it. He had almost made it to the base of the bridge when he heard, "Hey! Get outta there kid!"

      But it was too late. He bent down to tie his shoe and attached the small flat plate to the support where he hoped it wouldn't be noticed.

      "I quit!" he yelled at the foreman, and flipped him off for good measure. He was retired.

      Across the union, the same scenarios were repeated again and again. Final coats of paint and detonators were applied. The grapevine spread word of the time: nine a.m., eastern standard time.

� � �

      Regina made herself comfortable on Tom's lap, or as comfortable as she could, given the circumstances. And he was cuddly, in a grandfatherly sort of way, his obvious personality defects aside. Thankfully, he didn't do anything to creep her out.

      When she was nestled into place, the hatch before her began to close. "I suppose we should have seatbelts," Tom said, "but I think you'll find it's a very smooth ride."

      And it was. The motions were so smooth and fluid it was quite like flying. The chief drawback to this mode of transport, she thought, was that there was nothing to see. Then again, she didn't want Tom to make the walls disappear again in an effort to entertain her.

      She reached over and took the book off of the shelf. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, it said. Of course, it did. She looked at the first pages. It was apparently a first edition. She suspected that all of Tom's books were.

"Great book," he said. "Have you read it?" Regina indicated that she had.
"Great guy. I wish he was around to see this."

"See it? He invented it," Regina said with confidence.

      "Eh?" Tom said. "No, he didn't. But he was well connected, and he kept his ears open. Good writers always do. The submarine goes back to da Vinci, anyway. But a lot of what folks call creative writing is really more akin to prophecy."

"Predicting the future?"

      "Well, we can make educated guesses and predict the future. But there's something about creating art, especially when undergoing elevated states of consciousness, that seems to let people tap into what Carl Jung coined the collective unconscious. A sort of group mind."

"And since there is no time..." Regina said.

      "Right," Tom concluded. "All information, past, present and future, is available to us now. For instance," he went on, "many scientific discoveries occur almost simultaneously at different points around the globe. That is information from the future, entering our consciousness like a spark."

"Wow," Regina said.

      "That's not to discount the scientific method and hard work," Tom said, "but some technology is positively alien in origin."

Regina had no doubt of this but said, "Prove it," anyway.

      "Okay. Prior to Roswell, which I assume you are familiar with, this country used vacuum tubes. Post Roswell? Integrated circuits. That technology literally fell out of the sky."

"It could be coincidence," she countered.

      "Not to those of us in the know. And there's no such thing as coincidence. The real pity, it seems to me, is that it was such outmoded technology we'd have developed it ourselves in another thirty years. And perhaps done it better. Trinary instead of binary, for instance. Then again, it is firmly established that we humans cannot meet the demands of advanced technology. I cite Hiroshima, Nagasaki, et cetera."

"That was the work of men and politics, not technology," she protested. "Exactly. And women would fare no better."
"What? How can you say that? Women are superior to men in many ways.
More empathetic, for instance."

      "Behind every great man, Regina, is often a greater man. And whispering in their ears are women. Or, that used to be the case. Perhaps that is why so many aliens embrace homosexuality."

"Now you're just pulling my leg," Regina said.

      "Not at all Regina. You'll find it's a time-honored technique still employed today. Homosexuality as a screening device. The Freemasons, Skull and Bones, the Catholic Church, the military. You cannot progress beyond a certain level in these organizations without a lot of gay sex."

"I see," she said.

      "And 'alien' can mean many things, Regina. Have you ever heard of the Nephilim?"

"Fields of the Nephilim, the goth rock band?"

      "No. Interesting name, though. The Nephilim are present in the Old Testament. They're also called the Watchers. They stood ten feet tall and commanded advanced technology on a barely post-stone age earth. What does that sound like to you?"

"Aliens," Regina replied.

      "Yes, and it says they lusted after Earth women. Of course, in the Bible, they are angels."

"Angels... devils..." Regina said.

"That's right. To humans they are effectively the same thing."

      "Then where are they now?" she asked. She felt it was a reasonable question.

"My dear, they are all around us." Regina looked around.
      "Oh, not here Regina. Their bloodlines merged with ours thousands of years ago. Only faint traces of their lineage are detectable today. And do you know what I think defines humanity?"

"I have no idea."

      "Compassion. And aliens, like corporations, do not have any inborn compassion towards humans. Somehow, that characteristic remains with us today, in their descendants."

"A person without any compassion is a psychopath," Regina said. "Quite."



Chapter 9 - Global Search
      Captain Dan could do little but wait, and it was incredibly difficult. Hans did his best to draw him into conversation.

"They've stopped again, sir. Any theories?"

"None whatsoever, Filthy. I'm hoping we'll learn more in the coming two
hours."

"Three hours, sir. And we'll be out of fuel by then."

      "Then just steady ahead to that stopping point. We'll improvise when we get there. There might be something present that gives us some ideas."

      He tried to distract himself with the news, but found the chatter incomprehensible. Everyone was speculating on what tomorrow would bring, but no one had a clear view of the future, obviously. The corporate media was urging everyone to go to work, school, and to continue shopping, above all. Meanwhile, the patriot network was in full bloom, and had convinced a great percentage of the population to ride the next few days out at home.

      Three hours later, and they had no new information, just a seemingly limitless expanse of sea that refused to yield any secrets. Except there was one thing. The sub had started circling the point at which it had stopped. It seemed foolhardy, but Dan elected to remain over the spot where it had last surfaced until daybreak, in the hope that something would change for the better.

What that might be, Dan had no idea. Just a hunch.

      It continued to circle all night. He was tempted to call in the fleet, but he felt brawn would only get Regina hurt or killed. He posted a watch, and then turned in for five hours of much needed sleep.

� � �

"How could aliens interbreed with humans?" Regina asked.

      "Ah. Well, therein lies the rub. Unless alien DNA is remarkably adaptive, which we cannot rule out, then we must share a common heritage. Look at that. We're halfway down."

"How deep is that?"

"We're about twenty-two thousand feet under the sea." "What's that in leagues?" she asked jokingly.
"A league is a..." he began.

"Measure of distance, I know. Twenty thousand parsecs under the sea." "Good one," he said. "Would you like to watch us dock?"
"I would, actually."

"Close your eyes, Regina," he said.

      It was counterintuitive, but of course she understood, at that point. For a moment it was impossibly black, blacker than merely closing your eyes could ever hope to be. And then it became brighter and brighter until she could see the outline of a gigantic whale.

"The sperm whale. Natural enemy of the giant squid." "Should I be scared?" she asked, never opening her eyes. "You should never be scared again," he said. "Observe."
      The whale's eye flashed three times with a brightness that cut through the darkness for hundreds of feet. The squid began to accelerate as it had toward the sub. As it neared, Regina's view changed from the squid's eye-view to a side view.

      Tom put his arms around her as the squid spun around, delivering to Regina the most intense feeling of vertigo she'd ever experienced. Its tentacles billowed out and encircled the whale's torso. The actual docking was as gentle as a mother's embrace, or the kiss of a lover.

"Shouldn't the whale swim at lesser depths than the squid?" Regina asked.

"Do you like bowling?" Tom asked.

"In theory," she said. "I've never bowlinged, uh, bowled before." "You've come to the right place, then."
      The hatches opened and they stepped down into a brightly-lit corridor. To Regina's astonishment, there was a complete regulation bowling lane and a replica of a fifties jukebox.

"Is there anything you want to hear?" Tom asked.

      Before he could even get the words out, the jukebox started playing on its own. It was "Yellow Submarine" by the Beatles, and Regina giggled, which made Tom laugh and smile as well.

"I see you found the controls," Tom said, somewhat impressed. "Yeah, it's weird," she said. "It just comes to me."
Tom said nothing for a while, and then a bowling ball emerged from a chute.

      "Well then," he began "The name of the game is bowling. You get a maximum of two rolls in which you try to knock down ten pins. Scoring is cumulative."

"Hit the things with the ball. Got it."

      Tom bowled a perfect strike on his first roll, and Regina thought it looked easy. But the ball was so heavy, she could barely lift it.

      "I'm sorry, Regina. I didn't plan on having a guest. This is my one self- indulgence. I should have made a lighter one for visitors."

"Aside from ruling the world, you mean."

      "Well it's a thankless job that someone must do. Lift the ball at your right elbow, and also with your left hand."

She did so with a look of serious concentration.

"Now bring it back as you step forward. Three steps, all in one motion." Regina launched her first gutter ball.
"Try again..."

      When she did, it found its way to the center of the lane and rolled straight through, giving her a perfect strike as well.

"Hey!" she said, "No fair."

      "I did that to make a point, Regina. Can you imagine if everyone, or even several people, had access to these powers? The potential for abuse is incalculable."

"People would tear each other apart."
"Exactly," Tom said. "Okay, let's play. No cheating this time, I promise." They played two games, and she improved steadily with each frame. Then
Tom said, "We're here."

      A wave of nervous anticipation swept over her. The hatch opened and they stepped down a ramp into what looked to Regina like a subway tunnel or a sewer, except that it was far too clean. When Regina turned around, she was startled by the presence of the whale from which she had descended.

"It's so big!" she exclaimed.

      "Yes, we grow them big down here, as you shall see. They're marvelous creatures. Globally protected, you know. Which is why they're the perfect cover."

Regina peered into the icy black river that ran through the center of the
tunnel.

      "I wouldn't get too close," Tom warned. "The cold alone would kill you if fell in. Not to mention the water pressure, which would mangle you."

"That's comforting," Regina said.

"Well, we're safe up here. Let me show you around."

      Tom and Regina entered via a portal that opened in the wall. She sensed motion in all three dimensions and knew it was no ordinary elevator ride. When they had reached their intended destination, the elevator stopped and the ceiling disappeared, followed quickly by the walls descending, leaving them in a verdant field with rolling hills and a tree line in the distance.

The sun shone above their heads.

      "Is this real?" Regina asked. "It's like I went into Bug Bunny's tent. Worlds within worlds."

"The sun and sky are artificial. The plants and animals, however, are real." "This is paradise," Regina said.

"Literally," Tom replied.


Society collapsed at nine a.m.


� � �


      The detonators were synchronized to within a minute of each other. Many of the explosions were spectacular, but by far, what happened in Port Allen, Louisiana was the worst.

      The old Mississippi river trestle serviced rail traffic from the north. In Port Allen, a host of chemical plants awaited the raw materials and catalysts needed for continued operation. The entire bridge had been recently repainted. The coating mixed in with the paint, when detonated, could cut through twelve inch steel beams with ease.

      A two hundred car automated train carrying a wealth of noxious, toxic chemical was crossing at the time of the blast. The bridge creaked and groaned, and then began to give way. One after another the tankers began to hit the ground. Many of them ruptured on impact, and some actually exploded. Benzene, chlorine, liquid propane, nitric and sulfuric acid, and a host of other volatile and dangerous toxins were unleashed on the land, air and water. That section of real estate would never be inhabitable by man again. In an instant, one third of the petroleum industry was shut down.

      Gas meters and exposed natural gas headers exploded from Vancouver to Mexico City and beyond. As if that weren't enough, some self-styled revolutionaries had taken to driving around shooting the propane canisters in front of convenience stores.

      Casualties, however, were low. Rioting and looting were nonexistent, no doubt due in part to the gun-friendly laws passed in most regions. The press were the first to respond, of course, and they attempted to spin it as the work of anti- government forces.

      It was also called the worst case of terrorism the world had ever known. But strangely, no leads were available, and no arrests had been made. The President, however, knew it was the work of pro-government factions, however loosely knit. By nine forty-five, he was broadcasting.

      "Friends, I want to commend you all on your composure during this crisis. I realize it is difficult to stand by and do nothing. But property loss is nothing compared to human lives. The police and fire service, both public and private, are working diligently on the problem. There is no need to involve yourselves as of yet."

      For now, there are surprisingly few casualties. I will point out that those killed, numbering fewer that one hundred, were all citizens who failed to heed my request to stay at home. Tragedies that could have easily been avoided."

      Since the forces that have caused the current situation refuse to return my daughter, I've elected to enact my final piece of legislation."

      At eight p.m. tonight, although I am loath to use the unconstitutional power of executive order, I am dissolving all corporate charters in the union."

      Corporations are not people, and until this fiction is done away with, corporations remain a threat to our safety and livelihood. Because if a corporation could be considered a person, it would be a psychotic and amoral character."

After that, I shall resign. God save the union. Thank you and farewell."



Chapter 7 - Uncivil War
      An uneasy silence fell across the country like a shadow. Citizens avoided commerce areas like the plague. The streets were given over to police and emergency vehicles. The National Guard was mobilized. People met in small groups in their neighborhoods, both indoors and out. The general consensus was that this was a matter between factions far removed from the common man, but that the outcome affected them all.

      The White House, having said their peace, remained silent. The press, however, were having a field day. They called upon the President to declare martial law. Blame for the sabotage was placed on separatists who wanted to dissolve the union. Thus the attacks were attributed to anti-union, anti-government groups when they were in fact conducted by supporters of President Long, a major propaganda coup.

Needless to say, Regina was not returned.

      Captain Dan was making final preparations for her rescue, and at last he had a plan. Studying the data from the nanobots, Filthy remarked that they appeared to have gone deeper than the ocean floor.

      That was the breakthrough they needed to put it all together. When they pursued the submarine, they had imagined an island fortress or perhaps an aircraft carrier. They were fully unprepared to battle at forty thousand feet below sea level. But they were a Navy research vessel, and so they had some advantages. Filthy, however, didn't want to cooperate.

      "Sir, I protest. This is madness. The bathysphere is only rated for thirty-five thousand feet."

      "Yes, but that prototype diving suit we have is rated to forty-five. Do the math, I'll be fine."

"That is the stated theoretical maximum, Dan." Filthy had never addressed him so informally before.

"You understand engineering, Filth. Those bathys can probably handle twice
that."

"You're not trained to dive at those depths. No one is."

      "I appreciate your concern, Hans, really. But I have a job to do. At least one life is at stake, and the way things look, a whole lot of lives may be at stake. So what's one washed-up old sea captain?"

Hans sighed. "Okay, but for the record, you're crazy." "You know this," Captain Dan agreed.
      They positioned the boat so that the bathysphere was positioned near the point at which Regina and her captor entered the sea floor. Dan was wearing a bulky pressurized suit woven out of tungsten and titanium. The suit's internal skeleton would retain its shape despite the devastating water weight it would encounter.

      "Okay," Filthy said. "One crazy captain, check. Thirteen thousand feet of bathysphere cable, check. Half-baked plan destined for disaster..."

      "Check," Captain Dan added. "I think that's everything. Remember, spool it out to the end and radio me before you're there. I'll pull the emergency cable release."

"Madness," Filthy remarked.

"I'm serious about this one, Hans," Captain Dan said. "Dead serious," Hans agreed.
      They double-checked their position and Dan began his descent into the unknown.

                          � � � "Show me something," Regina said.
"Well," said Tom. "Dinosaurs are sort of clich�, aren't they?" "Uh, no."

"I have something better. Let's take a ride."

      Presently, a vehicle that resembled a two-person paddleboat glided silently up to them and they got inside. It dipped slightly and Regina realized it was hovering. But not using air, as far as she could tell. It was totally silent. They came upon a quaint cottage near a copse of trees. It reminded Regina of something out of a black forest fairy tale, and she got a small chill. Tom opened the door and went inside.

      "My summer home," he called back to her. She stuck her head inside and looked around. Everything looked handmade and ancient. Regina noticed her fingernails were considerably longer than they had been earlier. She leaned her head back. Her hair was longer, also. Odd.

      She watched Tom open a kitchen cabinet and take out a small dish, but she didn't know what it might hold.

"Let me show you the stables," he said. Sugarcubes, Regina thought. Of course.
      They followed a path through the trees behind the cottage to a similarly- styled set of stables. Down the hillside, she could see ponies frolicking and began to feel giddy.

      "He's shy, remember," Tom said. "That's what these are for." He handed her four lumps of sugar.

      But when they entered the stable proper, she got the shock of her life. Standing in a stall, regal and proud, was a huge white horse with a twisted mother- of-pearl horn growing from the space above its eyes. Regina gasped in delight, and was otherwise speechless. Fearlessly, taking no notice of Tom, she opened the half- door and entered the stall. The unicorn snorted at her once, as a sort of greeting, and looked her in the eyes. There seemed to be an intelligence present that was far beyond any ordinary horse. It's magic, she thought.

      The horse leaned its head down. "Pet me," Regina heard him say. With her empty left hand, she did so. Then she raised her right hand and fed him all four cubes at once.

"Do you like him, Regina? His name is-".

      "Shadowfax, I know. Like in Tolkien." She continued to stroke his mane, mesmerized.

"He's yours, if you want him," Tom said. "I do," she said breathlessly.
"Then you'll stay and apprentice with me?" Tom asked. "I have a choice?"
      "We all have a choice, Regina. I don't mean you're free to leave, now. But I can't force you to apprentice for me. It's a choice."

She regarded this proposal silently.

"Don't answer now. Get acquainted, and then I'll show you around."

      Tom allowed her plenty of time with her steed, and then they took the hovercar to a tunnel in a stone mountain.

� � �

      Filthy spooled out the lifeline that tethered the bathysphere to the ship. A lifeline and not merely a cable, he reminded himself, because it delivered air, power and communication as well. Without it, the bathy would be on reserve electricity and air, which would last for an hour at best.

      On emergency power, only the gyroscopes and servos that balanced it and kept it upright, along with the radio, would function. He must really be in love, Hans thought. Too bad he's as good as dead. He briefly wondered if he would be given command of the ship when that happened.

      Dan was growing impatient. "Step it up, Filth. I got an appointment," he said over the radio.

      Reluctantly, he increased the drop speed to nearly freefall. If he didn't, he knew Dan would hit the cable release early, which would greatly increase his

chances of being blown off course. Ocean currents were more forceful than even the flow of the Mississippi, and much less predictable.

At eleven thousand feet, Hans informed Dan of the remaining cable.

      "Hans, you're a great first mate, and an outstanding officer. If I don't return..."

"Yes?" Hans asked. "Take my ship..." "Yes?" Hans asked again. "...and have it detailed."
      Hans turned red. His foolhardy captain thought he was immortal, obviously. Dan began his long descent. At one thousand feet remaining, Filthy began the countdown.

"Nine hundred...eight hundred..."

At one hundred, Dan pulled the cable release. "See ya," was the last Filthy heard from him.
      The interior lights switched off, leaving Dan with only the instrument panels to see by. Outside, there was nothing to see. His first thought as he severed the lifeline was, "I must really love her."

His second was that he was seriously in trouble. "Come in, Hans," Dan tried, to no avail.
      Battery power couldn't push the signal far enough through the water to establish radio communication. He was on his own.

      The bathysphere continued to gain speed as it fell. Worse yet, it began to tumble. Soon Dan felt like a load of laundry, or a kid at a carnival. The jets and servos whined in an effort to right the doomed capsule as it spun out of control. The

fall speed increased, along with the rotation, and the fins that steadied the bathysphere began to snap off.

Well, this is it, Dan thought.

      The bathy's plunge continued, and he began to get motion sickness from the wild rotations he was experiencing. Finally, Dan threw up into the interior of his helmet. This was not how he had planned to spend his last moments on Earth. He had secretly hoped to spend the next forty years with Regina, and die in their bed.

The best laid plans of mice and men...

      His last thoughts were that riding a bathysphere to the bottom of the ocean until it cracked open from the pressure was probably not the most well thought-out scheme he'd ever had. He hoped Regina was safe.

� � �

      Some distance into the catacombs, Tom stopped. A platform beneath the hovercraft began to rise, and Regina looked up to see a smooth, round tunnel overhead. A minute later, and they were beneath a huge dome on the ocean floor. Even though it was pitch black, Regina could sense what was above them, an entire ocean and all it contained.

      Clearly reading her mind, Tom switched on the dome's exterior lights. A multitude of nightmarish creatures revealed themselves to Regina. Fat, ugly little piranha-type fish with lights on their heads. Long, snakelike fish with great needles for teeth.

"Turn if off, please," Regina pleaded. And so he did.
      "I'm afraid it's not all unicorns and ponies under the dome, Regina. Though I did want to show you a lion and lamb that are somehow best friends forever. Have you considered the apprenticeship? I have something that may sweeten the deal."

      He led her to a cluster of modern, single-story buildings, and opened the door to one of them. It had the sterile look and feel of a hospital. They entered a room in the center of the structure. On the wall were what looked like the doors to a

gigantic filing cabinet. Or a morgue. One of the drawers opened, revealing a body covered by a sheet.

Great, Regina thought, it was a morgue.

Tom pulled the sheet halfway down, revealing a younger version of himself. "Who's that?" Regina had to ask.
      "I told you I had the body of a forty-two year old, Regina. That's me. Or my doppelganger, I suppose. A clone. But when he is awakened, he'll have my knowledge, power and abilities. Even memories."

"Wow," Regina said.

"So what do you think? Could you imagine yourself with young Tom, here?
The new Adam and Eve?" "What?"
      "History became legend, Regina. Legend became myth. But I assure you, the heart of the tale is real."

"There was a first man and woman?"

      "There were many. The Earth is a bit of a failed experiment, I'm afraid. We seed the race, they evolve, and eventually wipe themselves out. Lather, rinse, repeat."

"I don't believe it," Regina remarked.

      "Then you haven't paid close enough attention to history. The ancient Vedic texts of India describe aerial warfare, atomic bombs, energy weapons. A global thermonuclear war, in other words."

      In fact, there is physical evidence that persists to this day. Around the world, there are great sheets of green glass, miles in diameter. It's formed when the heat of an atomic blast melts silica."

"I find that all a little hard to believe."

      "I'm afraid it's true. Sometimes it's war, sometimes it's viruses, disease. The human race is tragically suicidal. In ten thousand years, we go from the Stone Age to the Space Age. Then we mostly die."

"Mostly?"

      "Well, it's rare that everyone is killed. There are always isolated pockets of people that survive. Part of what I do is help catalog and restock the planet. You have to have a balanced ecosystem."

"So, you're a zookeeper?"

"Sort of. That's part of what I do." "And what I would do, right?"
"If you so choose."

"Can I stay here and think about it?" "Of course."
"You know, you're a few inches shorter than I like them, Tom." "Stature, Regina, is not a function of height or weight."
"I guess I agree with that."

"Okay, well, come find me when you've made up your mind."

      Regina could feel his presence receding. When Tom had fully left, she walked closer to his clone. Unable to resist, she peeked under the sheet. His member was impressive, even in its flaccid state.

"Huzzah," she said. "A girl could get used to that, anyway."

      But it was just idle curiosity. Regina placed her mouth on Tom's, kissed him goodbye, and opened his jugular vein with her ever-growing nails. His life's blood began to pool on the table, and then ran onto the floor. No alarms sounded. Hubris, she thought. No alarms, and no defenses. Tom thought he was untouchable. But his blood ran red like just everyone else.





Chapter 8 - Rescue?
      Dying in his own puke was still not how Dan wanted to go out. The g-force he was experiencing was too disorienting, however. One of his last gestures was a wild flailing of his arms, which resulted in a switch being thrown. A switch that should have been deactivated when the power was disconnected. Due to an engineering oversight, the bathysphere's massive exterior lights illuminated briefly, blinked three times and then the batteries gave up the last of their power.

� � �

      Regina caught up with Tom, whom she found trimming roses outside of his summer cabin.

      "So," he said, never taking his eyes off of his work, "Have you thought it over, already?"

"I've decided...to accept. Teach me."

      "Excellent! I had hoped you would, but I wasn't sure. Part of you is inscrutable, even to me."

"Tell me more about this garden," she demanded.

"Well," he began, "these are antique tea roses from cuttings collected from-" Regina cut him off. "No, the garden. This place." She gestured around her. "I'm afraid of challenging your religious beliefs, Regina."
"Why?"

"Because I am considerate of your feelings." "Faith, sir, is independent of facts."
      "Perhaps. Personally, I am of the opinion that facts can ultimately strengthen and re-enforce faith. But I'm something of a deist."

"What's that?"

      "A deist tends to believe in a creator that set the universe in motion, the laws of nature, and then lets things run their course. Ben Franklin was a deist."

"That disregards the miraculous."

      "No, that accepts the miraculous as a given. People focus on details and miss the importance. God, the universe, existence. The fact that we're here at all is miraculous. The rest is petty arguing of details and minutia, often rooted in historical inaccuracies."

"Like how?" Regina asked.

"Like, Jesus Christ was named neither Jesus nor Christ?" "What?"
"Yeshua Bin Joseph is the gentleman in question's correct full name." "Then why isn't that taught?"
"Who knows? It just goes to show how things invariably get twisted." "I guess," Regina said, somewhat unhappily.
      "But the point is that the miraculous is already there, all around us. I may wield a great deal of power, but I assure you there are powers that so eclipse my own as to render them meaningless. The universe runs by a set of rules we can't normally perceive."

"Shit happens," Regina said.

"Yes," replied Tom. "Shit does indeed happen." "Then why tinker? Why dabble with political swine?"
      "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, Regina. I keep tabs on world leaders. Extend them certain offers. If they accept, they are dealt with in due time. That may change from loss of their place in the political hierarchy to termination or exposure. There's a method to my madness, Regina."

"That almost sounds like fun."

"It can be. It's a lot of trips and dinners. Does that sound okay with you?" "It kinda does."
      "It's fun, at least the first hundred years or so. Shaping history! The novelty wears off."

"Kinda like this place. Where do I sleep?"

"You may have the summer home. I'll just sleep in my office." "Thanks. G'night."
      "Just one more thing, Regina. Since you've signed on an apprenticeship, I've gone ahead and initiated that program series. There will be nanoprobes and implants."

"Eek."

"You may feel slightly feverish." "Well okay, then," she said.
"Enjoy my library, Regina," Tom said as a farewell.

      When the squid grabbed the bathysphere, Dan hit his head on the interior of his helmet and was knocked out cold.

      When he came to, there were bright lights and what appeared through his fouled helmet to be a parquet floor. And no water. Unbelieving, Dan sat for five minutes pinching himself before accepting the fact that he was neither dead nor dreaming. Then he hit the hydraulic release. The bathy's sensors, noting the oyxgen and distinct lack of water pressure, opened up smoothly.

      Captain Dan saw the bowling alley but went directly to the table and chair. He was more interested in getting out of his disgusting diving suit. Later, he decided

the irony was not that he was trapped in a bowling alley, but that the bathysphere blocked most of the lane, detracting immensely from the experience.

� � �

      While Dan slept, Regina could not. Tom's library was enthralling. Tome after dusty tome, they were dusty leather-bound first editions, some handcrafted or handwritten. There seemed to be records of everything under the sun, even cryptozoology: yeti, Nessie, thunderbirds and more. Regina viewed a photo of a fifty-foot long snake and shuddered.

      Some volumes referred to distinctly alien races, while others revealed Earth's past. Apparently with the boom/bust syndrome the human race suffers from constantly retossing the gene pool, the archetypes of Tolkien were remnants of genetic memories. They called back to an earlier time when people were more elvish, more orcish. When wizards did walk the face of the earth alongside dragons.

      Or so she read, anyway. She pored over books into the morning, finally closing her eyes as the artificial sun began to beam. Her dreams were not pleasant. She had visions of Eden in flames, of crying animals reclaimed by the sea. Regina tossed and moaned.

� � �

      Dan had awakened, however, and was on the verge of urinating into his diving helmet when the side hatch unexpectedly opened. He yawned and stretched before stepping out into the tunnel. This was shaping up to be the easiest rescue ever. Then he turned and saw the massive sperm whale he had recently been bowling in and realized he perhaps shouldn't get too complacent. He spied a smaller tunnel in the western wall, and moved toward it. At least he was making incremental progress.

      Regina, now invaded by nanobots tying her to Tom's entire infrastructure, was unknowingly operating as she slept. When Dan stepped onto the circular elevator platform, Regina activated it, bringing him into a pastoral world where the sun was just beginning to rise.

      He actually heard a rooster crow. Maybe I am dead after all, he thought. It certainly was idyllic, and matched his ideas of paradise. But there would be no paradise without Regina, and so he ambled on. He turned around slowly and tried to get a feel for where she was being held.

"Try that cottage," a voice said in his head. It was Shadowfax.

      The wind picked up and blew in that direction. Everything in existence seemed to be saying yes, go to her now. Prepared for the worst, Dan consulted the globe. According to it, Regina was seventy-five yards away. He drew his only real weapon, his Tesla death ray.

      He crouched as he walked, having absolutely nothing to hide behind. Interesting architecture for a jail, Dan thought. He prowled the exterior, trying to look into the windows, but the curtains were drawn. At the door, Dan stood bolt upright and pressed his back to the wall, just as he had seen in every cop movie ever made.

He tried the knob. Unlocked. Then he set the death ray to kill.

      Finally, he screwed up enough courage to open the door, flinging it wide and turning to stand in the doorway, gun drawn.

"Freeze!" he was unable to not scream. He felt foolish even as he was saying
it.

      Regina jolted awake at this, and before she could open her eyes, everything in the room began to fly at her perceived attacker. Books, furniture. A paring knife from a bowl of pears embedded itself in the doorframe. The bowl and pears hit Dan in the chest. He was forced to fall back.

"Regina!" he cried.

      The onslaught stopped almost immediately as everything remaining crashed to the floor. She ran outside, and into Captain Dan's waiting arms. He was trembling slightly.

      "Well, if it isn't the Dirk Pitt wannabe," Regina said into his neck, and squeezed him tighter.

"Who?" Dan had to ask.

"Psh," she answered. "What are you doing? It's not safe for you to be here." "Me? I'm here to rescue you."

"I don't need rescuing. I can take care of myself."

      "Well, your father's worried sick about you, and he's resigning the presidency tonight."

      "Oh," she said. That no longer seemed as important to Regina. She now wielded far more power than her father ever could have hoped to possess. The power to make things right.

Tom stirred in his sleep, and Regina knew he was about to awaken. "We need to get you out of here. What's your escape plan?"
Dan swallowed hard.

      "'Gulp' is not an escape plan, Dan. Clive Cussler would never write such a half-assed rescue."

"Who?" Dan asked again.

"We have to get you back to the ship." "Which ship?"
"The whale ship. Duh."

      It was all too much for Dan to bear. He came to rescue Regina, and now she was rescuing him instead.

And Tom was awake, Regina knew. She grabbed Dan's hand.

"Run!" she said.

� � �

      Tom stirred, and slowly came to full consciousness. He'd been using his powers to put himself into a deep sleep for years, but now realized he had made a mistake in letting his guard down. Because Regina had betrayed him. She had company, as well. He sighed wearily. Throughout Rapture, which is what he called it, not Eden, doors and gates and pens began to open.

Amateurs, he thought. Good help was so hard to find.



Chapter 9 - Fantasy Gone Wrong
      Regina pulled him along, but Dan kept watching the skies. "Birds?" he thought. But it was way too big to be even a condor.

"Look!" he told Regina. "Dinosaurs. How clich�." "Here there be dragons," Regina said.
      A molten fireball came hurtling down at them and hit the ground with such force that it created a huge crater, showering them both with dirt, rocks and clumps of sod. It was only happenstance that kept them from being splattered with magma.

"Oh, screw this," Dan said, and stopped running. He turned and drew his Tesla.
"No!" Regina screamed and grabbed his arm.

      Regina was strong, but Dan was stronger. He continued to aim and squeezed the trigger. An impossibly large plasma burst issued forth, barely missing the oncoming dragon.

"Ass," Regina hissed.

      They had little choice at that point but to keep running. Regina dragged Dan in another direction, this time forcing him to double back to the expanse of trees between the cottage and stable.

"Come on, dragonbait," she said.

"Good idea," he yelled, "The trees are a good-"

      A significant portion of the forest in front of them erupted into an inferno, forcing them to change direction yet again.

"-cover," Dan said halfheartedly.

      Regina realized her plan was going to endanger Shadowfax. Why hadn't she considered it before? She probed briefly with her mind and found the electronic latch that kept him in his stall, pushed it, and released her horse.

      "On my way," he told her. They cleared the trees just in time for Dan to see a unicorn emerge from the stables just before they were demolished, and incinerated for good measure.

"Of course," he muttered.

      Shadowfax raced to them, and then bowed as a Royal Lipizzaner stallion might during a performance. Dan didn't need to be told twice. He leapt onto the horse's back then reached for Regina's hand. He tried to pull her up behind him, but she refused, at the cost of several precious seconds.

      "Uh-uh," Regina said, "I'm driving." She got in front of Dan and grabbed a double handful of the mount's mane.

      Shadowfax needed no nudge or command, but raced smoothly forward, eyes turned upward to anticipate the next move from the saurian that was once the natural enemy of his species. Ahead of them lay the offices and medical complex. Surrounding these were lions, tigers and a bear. And a lamb.

      "Don't stop," Regina said aloud, although whether to Shadowfax or herself it was unclear.

      The animals were alerted to their presence by Tom, and formed a defensive perimeter at the leading face of the building.

"Don't stop," Regina said again, urging Shadowfax forward this time.

      He aimed for the bear. The lumbering ursine was the least capable of reacting quickly to his next move, which was to leap over it in a manner that seemed impossible. Magic, thought Regina as they sailed over it, narrowly missing its claws. It rose to its hind legs in a defensive stance.

      "Don't stop!" Regina commanded, and Dan braced for the impact as they passed smoothly through the brick wall.

      Regina could feel Tom's influence as he tried to allow the animals to enter behind them, and she pushed back with her own mind. He was more adept, but

Regina was younger and stronger, her mind untainted by sleep. The nanobots meant she had complete control, Tom's presence being her only impediment to ruling the world ultimately. She felt his mind reach out for his comatose clone, and the horror of realization as he made the terrible discovery that revealed the extent of Regina's betrayal.

      Tom's mind raced like a caged rat, searching for an out. With Regina holding the animals at bay, he was still dangerous, but without any real weapons to use against her. She led Dan toward his inner sanctum, and she felt his mind squirm in desperation.

"Don't kill him," Regina said.

      In silent agreement, Dan switched his Tesla from "kill" to "erase" as they advanced on the door to Tom's office.

      He tried it and it was locked. Regina reached through and unlocked it from the inside. Once past the door, she motioned for Dan to stay back and flank her as she approached Tom. He sat at his desk, a massive ornate chunk of solid oak, unarmed.

"Hello, dear Regina. I guess you don't mind me calling you that one last
time."

Regina remained impassive.

      "I must say, on one hand, I'm disappointed in you. However, your tenacity and moral character lets me know I made the right choice."

"Flattery will get you nowhere, Tom. It's over."

      "Perhaps, Regina. Because if I turn off the dome, Eden is finished. You die, I die. Your erstwhile hero dies. Shadowfax, and all remaining unicorns die."

"No! You wouldn't. You're bluffing."

      "Try me, Regina. If I die everything dies with me. And you'll never reach the surface as long as I'm alive."

      She knew that much was true. His influence was still strong enough to prevent them from safely taking a whale to the surface. Then there was the sub to

contend with. Dan, however, was done talking. He pointed the Tesla at Tom's head and fired. Nothing happened. The muzzle exploded with energy, there was light and sound, but Tom just stared at her.

"Oh, Regina. I'm disappointed in you! There's still so much for you to
learn."

      Dan continued to puzzle over the gun's ineffectiveness, and toggled the switch a few times.

"It appears we are at a stand off, Regina. Your hair is lovely, by the way."

      It had grown to her waist overnight. She had bitten her nails to the quick twice already, and they were again ridiculously long.

"And another thing-"

      A burst from the Tesla took the top of Tom's head off, and he slumped to the desk. Neither reacted for a moment, and then Dan and Regina ran to each other and embraced.

"Sorry. He left me no choice." She gripped him tighter.
"It's okay," she said. "But I guess this is goodbye."

      They elected to spend the remainder of their lives in each other's arms. Eventually, Regina realized nothing had happened. The dome was still intact. When she finally stepped back, her nose was bleeding.

      "Did I hug you too tightly?" Dan asked, wiping it away with his finger and showing her.

"Stress, probably. Don't worry about me," she said. "We should get out of
here."

"This place should be destroyed," Dan said. "Only if you never want to see me again."

He had no reply to that.

"Look," Regina said, and pointed at Tom's head.

The top of his skull was gone and the cranial cavity was empty. "Where's his brain?" she asked.
      Dan puzzled over this as well. His skullcap had been neatly removed, but at least half of his brain should have been present.

"I'm no expert. Maybe the Tesla evaporated it?"

      But neither really accepted this explanation. They walked hand in hand back to Shadowfax. The animals were back to normal.

      Under other circumstances, both Regina and Dan would have been amused at the sight of a lion affectionately licking the head of the lamb that lay beside it, a scene straight off the cover of Watchtower Magazine. Instead they regarded them suspiciously, as though even the lamb might leap to its feet and attack them.

      Regina's nose continued to bleed. They rode Shadowfax to the cottage, talking all the while about what had happened.

      "Why didn't the Tesla erase his memory?" Dan asked. "And why won't your nose stop bleeding?"

"I dunno," Regina said. But she did know. Or she had a damn good idea. "And what happened to his brain?" he wondered aloud.
      At the cottage, they dug around the piles of books, selecting the most important looking titles, and grabbed all they could reasonably carry, each filling large green pillowcases. Shadowfax took the additional burden in stride. As they made their way to the ocean tunnel, Regina felt that her connection with Eden had grown stronger. Not an emotional bond so much as a physical one.

"Leaving so soon, Regina?" Tom's voice said in her head.

      She screamed and clawed at her ears, doubling over in pain. Unbelievable, she thought, when thinking became possible again.

      "Regina?" Dan was asking, crouching over her. At first she batted his hands away from her, but then allowed him to lift her to her feet as the pain subsided. She concentrated intently for a moment, and then began walking to the clone lab, oblivious of Dan and his concerns.

      "Stay here," she told him when they'd reached the lab. She passed through this time, leaving him on the other side of the locked door. Dan fumbled with the knob and yelled for her. Each time he struck the door her head pounded with it, like she had taken on all the world's hangovers. The savior of heavy drinkers. She flung her hand back over her shoulder with a dismissive gesture and froze him in place.

      "You're making a big mistake, dear Regina," Tom said, crippling her with pain again.

      At once, two drawers opened from the wall, side by side. There was an infant boy and an infant girl, not twins, but clearly the same age. Regina's heart leapt, as does the heart of any woman of purity when confronted with babies.

      "It's us," Tom said, being brief so as to minimize her pain. Nevertheless, blood leaked from her eyes like tears, and pooled in the wells of her ears.

"We can transfer into them at any time. We can stop and start our aging." Regina began to scream.
"You can be your own mother, and raise yourself anew."

      A happy childhood, she thought as she blacked out. But even a sleeping Regina was a powerful Regina, and she was no longer in agony. She and Tom were beings of pure thought, formless. This time she felt no pain as he spoke.

      "I'm old because it's a good disguise, when I'm in the world. Did I ever tell you of the Cathars, Regina?"

"No," she whispered.

      "They were gnostics who believed that once they established a personal relationship with God, they would not die, but only their hair would gray."

      "Wow," Regina said, trying not to sound patronizing. She unfroze Dan with the faintest tip of her mind, and hoped Tom didn't notice. She tried the lock, to no avail.

"So you could say it's against my religion to cut my hair." Regina squirmed.
"Stay with me, Regina."

      Dan didn't have three hundred seconds. He grabbed a large fire extinguisher and proceeded to bash at the handle of the electronic lock until it snapped off. Then he hacked at the wood surrounding it until he was able to knock the door open. Regina woke up screaming. Her body felt as is if it was being poked with needles, and then tiny blooms like burns began to blossom across the landscape of her body.

"If I can't have you, Regina, then no one will."

      Tom applied what felt like electricity to her erogenous zones. At the same time, he launched a concerted attack on Dan. Initially it consisted of an array of whirling knives and scalpels that would have made Jack the Ripper feel intimidated, and she countered by encasing Dan in a protective force field.

      "If it bothers you to think of it as God, Regina, if it offends your post-post- modern sensibilities, then consider existence a simulation, a program executing on a computer somewhere."

      When the first wall safe hit Dan, Regina knew she'd have to change tactics. He, too, joined the nosebleed club, albeit for different reasons. His blood left a question mark-shaped smear on the inside of the force field.

"Okay," she said. "Have it your way, Tom."

      Regina had never been much for video games, but now she faced the most challenging game she could imagine. She took control of Dan. Her own body she left behind, slipping out of the top of her pain like escaping steam. She'd be feeling it in the morning, she thought. Suddenly, Dan was a passenger in his own body. She manipulated him in expert fashion, sliding between weapons, leaping and twisting, as her mind probed for Tom's physical location.

      Even Tom was incredulous of her ability. Attacking them took every ounce of his concentration as he also tried to conceal his whereabouts. Regina opened the last of the cabinets with her mind, and realized that she had been directed away from looking there sooner. The doors swung open to reveal heavy-duty glass vessels, one of which contained a human brain. The other was opaque with a milky blood, and Regina realized with mounting horror that her brain was being moved to the second container.

      She directed the Tesla toward Tom's brain as she continued to maneuver Dan across the room. She felt his mind go as she fired, Eden itself going limp, now fully unable to resist her will. The resultant heat caused the tank to shatter when the water expanded. Regina stood there shuddering for a full minute.

      When she opened her eyes, Dan said, "You missed one," and looked down. A scalpel was embedded in his thigh. But he pulled it out and walked it off, as she silently patched his wounded leg with her hard-won powers.

      "Let's go," she said, turning her back on the room. She didn't want to look or linger. Or think.

      But first Dan grabbed Tom's ancient brain, so long preserved, and carried it with him. It was smaller than he thought a brain would be, about the size of two fists, and also slimier. On the way out, Dan walked fearlessly up to the lion and extended his hand. The lion sniffed, and then gave him a friendly lick. He produced the brain with the other hand, and put it in front of the its nose. It gave a slight roar, perhaps remembering the days when its ancestors once knew such delights, and then grasped Tom's brain with both paws and began to lick it like a giant scoop of ice cream.

Shadowfax stayed behind.

      "Take care of the place," Regina told him, and she knew that he would. Wordlessly, they walked back to the tunnel, although neither thought they'd still have the strength to do so. They left Eden feeling like outcasts, banished from paradise. But they were too exhausted to weep. They rode up in a whale with an unobstructed bowling lane, but instead lay in each other's arms, her nose bleeding all the while.

      "Look," Dan said, and produced the globe from his pocket. "We're finally together." There was now a single purple dot where Regina and the globe's positions had merged.

      She arched her back toward him, cradling the globe to her chest, and turned her face toward his. He kissed her, blood and all.

      The sound of the hatch opening woke them about two hours later. They threw the table and chair into the whale and resumed their position on the floor as the squid swam to the surface. When they docked with the sub, her nose had stopped bleeding. Dan was cautious, expecting a fight, but Regina knew there was no threat and so she reassured him until he finally put the ray gun away. Although they didn't encounter any crewmembers, she knew they were there, under her exclusive command.

She felt better than she had in ages. It was seven fifty when she called her
father.

"Daddy?" she said at the sound of his voice. And there was much rejoicing.

When the "I love yous" had subsided, Regina said, "Don't step down, Dad.
We need you."

      But for the first time in her life, Regina viewed him as a figurehead. She did, however, convince him to abstain from dissolving all corporate charters for the time being, averting a major financial cataclysm. Thus began Regina Long's foray into politics. Her father was just happy to have her safe and wanted to make arrangements to meet her in Iceland that night.

"Tomorrow, Dad, okay? We just need some rest first."

      Dan and Regina agreed to keep as much secret as possible. They radioed their coordinates, and then surfaced. Regina summoned a crewman, who produced a four-person inflatable raft. Their intention was to wait for most of the hour they had before rendezvous sitting on the deck, using the sub to hold their position. Then they would take to the craft and send the sub below.

      What actually happened was that they fell asleep in each other's arms. Dan awoke fifty minutes later to the sound of gum being chewed in his ear.

      "I though that would get you up. Annoying, huh?" She smiled that smile of hers at him.

"Regina?"

"Yes, Dan?"

"What are you chewing?" "Fruit Stripe gum." "What flavor?" "Cherry... and apple."
"And how long have you been chewing it?" "Since you woke up..."
"Spit it out," Dan said, and put his hand up to her mouth. "But..."
"Now," he commanded. She did as instructed.

      He stuck the gum onto the deck and stood her up. Dan looked her in the eyes and kissed her.

"Regina?"

"Yes?"

"Jump!"

They both landed in the water, and then clambered over the side of the raft.
Dan began paddling away from the sub... "Send it down!" Dan yelled.
      Almost as soon as the conn tower was below the waves, the deck of the sub exploded. Dan and Regina were thrown nearly a hundred feet, and only survived because Regina encased them both in a force field. Eventually, a Navy clipper found them. They were fifteen minutes late to the rescue.



Chapter 10 - Betrayed
      They spent the night in a suite provided by the Icelandic government, and it was comfy indeed. At some point during their resting they found each other and made love. They repeated this sequence several times over the course of the night.

      The next day found Regina's head ablaze with possibility. Dan clung to her, not wanting to leave the sanctuary of their room. But she dressed him and eventually dragged him protesting into the cold sub-arctic sunlight. As they passed a record shop, Regina got chills. She stopped and listened. Pulling Dan to her, she pressed her mouth to his, and zapped him lightly with the Tesla's "erase" setting.

      Dan blinked in the sunlight as Regina walked away, turning to go into the record store. The boy behind the counter looked familiar. He had dyed black hair, mascara, and tattoos, but Regina recognized him anyway.

"What time is it?" she asked.

"There is no time any longer," he replied.

      With that, Regina slipped out the backdoor to meet her destiny. When Dan staggered in behind her, all that remained for him was a bittersweet song playing on the store's sound system.

" - as old as the sun
But the sun is much older Huh - ho, Regina
Huh - ho, Regina..."

"Hello, Regina," a voice in her head said. "Tommy! How are you?"
"I'm dead, Regina. You killed me." "Oh, yeah," she said. "Sorry."

"Perfectly understandable, Regina. How do you think I got my job?" "Really?"
"Yes, really. It's a bit of a flaw in the whole apprenticeship program." "Why take me on, then?"
      "I guess I was tired of living. It was a form of suicide. But I fell in love with you. By then, it was too late. The cycle is an ancient one, Regina. Kill the king. It can't be undone, to my knowledge. Once set in motion it has always, without fail, reached the same conclusion, murder. But I had no idea you'd be so powerful."

      "You underestimated my love for my father. Even now, I see this as freeing him. Freeing all world leaders."

      She paused in deep analytical thought. Her brain constantly formed new connections with the hardware that sustained her.

"Are you real, or am I crazy?"

      "I'm real. Real enough for you, anyway. I'm what you would call a flatline construct."

"Huh?"

"Ever read any Gibson?" "No."
"Dick?"

"What!"

"Sorry. It seems I no longer have one. I was referring to the prophet Philip
K. Dick's "Ubik", which is based on a similar theme. Essentially, I'm a dead guy inside of a computer. Come to think of it, the prophet Robert Heinlein wrote about it first, if I recall correctly."

"How does that work?"

      "The time for questions is over, Regina. Ask the Oracle. I'm just a subset of it, now."

"I'm sorry, Tommy," she said again. "Shit happens, Regina."
      She paused and consulted the Oracle. In milliseconds, Regina absorbed more knowledge than was possessed by all of the world's top neuroscientists, nanotechnicians and artificial intelligence programmers in the world.

"Oh," she said. "That seems simple enough. Where are you, Tommy?"

      "I'm a ghost in the machine, Regina. The computer, our computer, spans the globe. Short of destroying the planet, it can't be destroyed. It's self-aware and self- repairing. Self-replicating, even."

"Wait, doesn't that mean Douglas Adams was a prophet too?"

      "Hmmm, you know, I never considered that, but I think you're right. Neato," Tom said. "Of course, Regina, all writings, all art, comes from the mind of God. Any book can be sacred if you look at it right."
"I'm not convinced, Tommy. I think this is some people playing God." "Perhaps. But if you accept the idea of a creator, then you have to allow that
whatever happens is what he wants to happen." "Unless you're a deist," she added.
"Correct. Unless you are a deist. Are you, Regina? Have you found religion
yet?"

"God and religion aren't the same thing Tom."

      "Ho-ho! Touche', Regina. Well played. Whatever you call it, you and I are inescapably involved. I suppose we should try and make the best of it."

      "Tommy, will you stay with me? I know I have the Oracle, but can't I ask you? It's so...impersonal."

"Of course, Regina. You and I can be together forever if you so choose." There was another split second pause.
"I can bring you back," she said. "Can you? How delightful, Regina!" "I need to get home to Rapture."
"Eden," Tom corrected her.

      The Secret Service found Dan wandering around Reykjavik a few hours after Regina's second disappearance. They flew him to D.C., where Al and the President tried to debrief him. But Dan's memory of recent events had been wiped clean.

"What do you remember, Dan?" President Long asked. "Well, there was a unicorn...and a dragon."
Al slapped him hard across the face. "He's hysterical," Al grunted.
"Now, Al," the President said. "Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
Maybe he just thinks he saw fairy tale creatures. Was Mickey Mouse there, son?"

Al moved to slap Dan again, but the President grabbed his hand and put it
down.

"Again, Dan," the President asked, "Where do your memories end?"

      "We left the base, got picked up, you know that. I don't really remember Reykjavik. Then I was arrested."

"Now, now, Dan. You were brought into protective custody. Big difference." "Unconstitutional," Dan mumbled.

"Son, we did it for your own good, and for matters of national security." "Then it's the same old police state with a new coat of paint."
"We're not here for a political symposium, Dan. We need a plan."

"Plan yourself. Am I free to go, now? If I remember anything else, I'll call
you."

"We need you to rescue her again."

"Old man, you must be crazy," Dan said. "I nearly died just getting there.
And there's a dragon! How do you combat a dragon? Become a wizard?" The President remained unmoved by his impassioned plea.
      "Well, Dan, I guess we can't force you to help us. I thought you cared about Regina is all..."

Al slapped him again.

      The record store clone, Noodles, whisked her off to a safe house, where she underwent a stunning transformation. Her began to change color and length until she'd found a new look she liked. She ended up with a short blonde bob that felt airy and light.

      Regina sat stock-still and consulted the Oracle. Or rather, she ravished it. As an Nth generation programmer, among other things, she was more equipped to infiltrate the Oracle than the now centuries-dead designers had anticipated.

      Evolution had led to new cognitive adaptations that enabled her to probe and tug at the Oracle's surprisingly weak defenses. Tom, having such a long lifespan, didn't have the same advanced logic processes Regina's mind possessed. Any such system, she surmised, was defined by the differentiation between creator and user. She sought the weaknesses that enabled her to utilize the access granted as an apprentice to gain higher levels of control.

      The problem was that the system was heavily compartmentalized, and she was never sure if she had reached the highest security levels. Even so, she was the most powerful person on Earth. The Oracle's nanobots battled those from her implant, but it was one-sided. Al's design was to evade and escape, not confront. This continued unacknowledged by her until Tom spoke.

"Your implant, Regina. Turn it off. You're broadcasting your position."

      At once, production within her ceased. She sought answers locked within the deep vaults of the Oracle, and in large part, found them. She was in a computer, but one that utilized an entire planet. The Earth's natural resonance provided nearly unlimited computing power.

      What she did next surprised even the blas�', seen-it-all-and-then-some clones. Her face slowly began to lengthen and narrow, as if her long-term growth was filmed in time lapse. Her lips became fuller and darker. The chair had to be lowered, as Regina Long now stood four inches shorter. She had always wanted to be a size five. But even she didn't understand her power over matter itself. It seemed impossible.

"Wait'll they get a load of me," Regina said, mimicking Jack Nicholson.

      They left the safe house since her implant had broadcast their position, even though she could have safely passed her own father on the street and he would never even fathom how it was possible that she was once Regina Long.

She was now She, all that was. The archetype. Goddess.

      There was scarcely need for concern as Regina's sight began to gain dimension. She found that not only could she sense the presence of people in the area, their spatial relation and velocity plotted in 4D space, but that she could actually influence them to route around her, unconsciously avoiding and not noticing her. It was better than being invisible.

      At this rate, she thought, I might find out what that's like, too. She could see the lines of power subdividing the earth, ley lines, and understood that these were areas of concentrated power generated by harmonics of some sort, amplifying the intense electromagnetic energy present an the core of the planet. It was, after all, the world's largest nuclear reactor, mainly potassium-235 and nickel. Sure to stay warm for another few hundred thousand years or so.

      In the meantime, there was energy. So much energy, in fact, that Regina had to walk the ground like a mortal while she cleared her head. She knew too much, and it made her new, augmented brain hurt. She foresaw cataclysms ahead, the death of hundreds of thousands. Millions.

      The sub, naturally was incommunicado, dealing with a hull breech. They began to fly toward the airport nearest Eden. Regina was confident in her newly acquired powers, but she still wasn't going to jump out of a plane without a parachute if she could avoid it. As they flew along, pushed in part by her invisible hand to make record time, she withdrew to the ether. She visualized herself plunging into the Earth, getting smaller and smaller, soaring into the molten core of the planet.

      She spun and dipped, frolicking and basking in the intense heat, as soothing as a warm bath. Regina began to direct great mountains of it upward, displacing millions of cubic yards of water. Reykjavik was deluged. Scotland and Ireland were devastated by massive tidal waves. Greenland was covered with several feet of seawater. And all the while, the lava rose, spilling over and cooling, forming the foundations of a new island.

      When Regina was finally satisfied, the destruction she had caused barely registering with her, she wrenched Rapture free from the ocean floor and floated it up to the surface. The water that preceded the dome finished the cooling process on the island. Regina flew the massive bubble to a suitable location, setting it down as gently as a parent would place a child in bed.

      Satisfied with the placement, she removed the dome entirely. Thousands of animals looked up and blinked, seeing the true sun for first time. The dragons soared higher than they ever had before, joined by rocs, griffins, pterodactyls and other winged beasts. Regina could see everything. She turned off the ley lines, and looked beyond the daytime sky. She studied the telemetry of the stars and found she could even view them as they would be a millions years hence.

      It was here, for the first time, that Regina got an idea of the scope and scale of the universe. To the people of Earth, she now a god. Yet there were powers greater than her own. She felt both omnipotent and tiny at the same time.

      She examined projections of the weather around her island home, and casually adjusted the position of the Earth's poles until Rapture, soon to once again be Eden, was occupying the perfect spot, and guaranteeing ideal weather year round.

      Regina had, at this point, reached the coast nearest Rapture. She dismissed Noodles and the other clone that accompanied her, and stepped out on to the water to begin the walk home. She could move so rapidly now, the water stood still as she strode across it. Around the globe, seven billion people went through life unaware that they were moving so slowly as to be standing still, at least in comparison to her.

A few more days of this and I'll need a day off, she mused.



Chapter 11 - Hurricane Regina
      Dan, Al and the President were en route to Iceland when the devastation began. They had intended to reconnoiter there and then travel the rest of the way aboard the Mary Celeste II, which seemed fitting to Dan. Instead, they were unable to establish radio contact with the Icelandic airport on the northern coast.

"I got a bad feeling about this," Al said.

      He was in fact making a Star Wars joke, but Dan was too young and the President too old to notice. The NAU channels were coming alive with the news. From all indication, the planet was coming apart at the seams.

      Regina had brought about changes that would impact the planet for millennia. Great tectonic plates shifted in random, unnatural ways, unleashing tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes and new volcanoes. The San Andreas Fault, as predicted time and time again by geologists, gave way and most of Los Angeles fell into the earth. Southern California, as a whole, fared poorly. The sheer volume of water displaced by all the newly released lava raised sea levels by inches, chipping away at coastlines around the world.

"Sound like the end of the world," Al noted, somewhat unhelpfully.

      "Mr. President," Dan said, "We need a contingency plan. There are currently no available airports in the vicinity."

"It's not a problem, Dan. We just won't land." "Sir?"
"We're ditching, Dan. Al and I do it all the time, right Al?" "Every time I steal a plane," Al said. "Once."
      "Great," Dan said. "I've never parachuted before. I'm Navy for a reason. I don't even like to fly."

      "Suck it up, Princess," Al said. "We'll hold your hand, if it'll keep your panties dry."

The President felt a little diplomacy was in order.

      "It'll be fun, Dan. Al and I have been flying since right after Kitty Hawk. We won't let anything happen to you. We like you."

Al grunted.

"We need you," the President amended.
"I guess we don't really have a lot of options, at this point," Dan conceded. "Not unless you want to keep refueling and spend the next two days in the
air. I am the President, after all."

      Dan sighed. "How do I keep getting roped into these situations?" he lamented.

"You love her," Al said. "Just like we do." Dan gave him the eye.
"Maybe differently than we do."

      Dan refused to acknowledge this. Currently what he felt was so primal, it was difficult for him to comprehend. He was being drawn to Regina in a manner than evaded rational thought. More than biological, it felt somehow supernatural. He was understandably reluctant to share these feelings with others.

      Jumping out of an airplane was minor compared to some of the things Dan felt prepared to do for her, and it was more than a little frightening to contemplate. Intellectually, he knew she had recently dashed millions of souls on the rocky shores of her aspirations, whatever her motivations were.

      But emotionally? He felt that if she had done these things somehow, then they were the right things to do under the circumstance. He could not jibe the two conflicting thoughts. Taken together, they made no sense, even to Dan. Furthermore, he wasn't sure how he knew these things, but he knew them all the same. And he was being drawn back to her as surely as a fisherman reels in a fish.

      Dan revealed none of this to Al and President Long. Instead he feigned reluctance, all the while knowing he was following a pre-ordained path. Once he had been strapped, buckled and harnessed into his military grade parachute, and Al and the President had donned theirs, Al began instructing him on using it.

      "First of all, don't panic. We're only at twenty-eight thousand feet. Kid stuff. Follow our lead, don't pull the ripcord until we do. And keep your distance from us. Got it?"

Dan shook his head, "Yeah, but isn't there an emergency chute, too?" "The cord for that is at the bottom of the pack. But you won't need it." "Mr. President," Dan began.
"Robert, Dan. We're practically family, now."

"Uh, Robert. Will my ship be there when we splash down?" "That's the plan."
"And then what?"

      "Oh, it's too soon to be making plans that far ahead of time, Dan. Anything can happen. Let's just splash down first, okay?"

"Whatever you say, sir." "Four minutes," Al barked.
      Dan possessed none of the easygoing confidence of the other two, and spent the endless four minutes tensely clutching the subway-style hand straps over their heads while Al and the President reminisced.

"Betty Grable," the President said.

      "Dinosaur," Al countered. "She was old when you were born. Natalie Portman," he added.

      "Who?" the President asked. "Al, you have to remember my early childhood education came from my own grandfather's pin-up collection. My tastes are largely

his tastes."

"You should get out more," Al replied. "Even at sixty, Portman is stunning.
Not just her body, her face and attitude." "I just don't know who that is, Al." "Forget it. Time to die," Al said.
      Dan nervously glanced up at this, in time to see Al key in the code to open the side hatch of the cargo plane. The three stood side by side as the plane was filled with the roar of the engines and rushing wind.

      "See you boys later," the President said before stylistically falling backwards out of the plane.

      Sensing his nervousness, Al extended his hand to him. When he saw this, Dan lifted his own in response.

      "Pansy," Al grunted before leaping out and yelling the traditional "Geronimooooo!"

      Dan was standing alone in a plane he couldn't fly, and was programmed to dive into the ocean. Plus Regina was down there, somewhere. He hesitated a moment longer, then dove out of the bay. He saw his companions were still above the cloud cover. He kept his diving posture and began to catch up. Still, they penetrated the clouds ahead of Dan. When he did make it through himself, their chutes were already open. Instinctively, he reached for his own ripcord.

"Not bad, kid," Al said over the radio. Dan looked down.
"Uh, guys? What's with the island?" But he already knew.
      "You're the seaman, Dan," the President said, and he and Al exchanged chuckles.

      At somewhere around twelve thousand feet they noticed things flying beneath them.

"Dan, what's that?"

"You're the flyboys," Dan said smugly.

Shortly thereafter, the President said, "I refuse to believe my eyes."

      At ten thousand feet, Al and the President began veering away from Dan, their chutes partially collapsed. Dan continued his journey downward unaffected.

"Dan! What's happening?"

"I have no idea. I'll find Regina, don't worry."

      They fell faster than Dan, and he could tell by the arc of their descent that they were sliding down the surface of an invisible barrier that he was now inside of. A short while later, he entered the airspace of the dragons. They flew nearby, but made no move toward him. They were definitely aware of his presence, however. If anything, they seemed prepared to defend him, if need be.

      The dragons were frightening and beautiful. A lifetime of dinosaur movies somewhat inured Dan to the pterodactyls, but they were still something to see up close. It was the thunderbird that captivated his attention the most. It was a prehistoric relative of the condor, but this one had a fifty-foot wingspan. It spiraled upward on drafts, and almost never flapped its wings.

      Dan was so mesmerized that the next thing that got his attention was the trees and ground rushing up at him.



Chapter 12 - Dome
      Al and President Long felt like they were on the world's largest playground slide. There was no friction to speak of, but they continued to fall sideways as Dan plummeted behind them.

"Al, what should we do?"

"Do like I used to tell my wife," Al said. "What's that?"
"Lay back and enjoy it."

      When they had passed the midway point of the path they were traveling they began to pick up speed.

"Uh, Al?"

"Yeah?" Al was unsuccessfully trying to relight his cigar stub. "What's gravitational acceleration, again?"
"Nine point eight meters per second squared." "And how high would you say we are, Al?" Al peered down.
"Er, we're around six thousand feet up, I'd say." "And our estimated speed when we hit the water?"
"Hard to say. We're not in freefall, exactly. Eighty miles an hour, easily."

      It became hard to speak or be heard as their speed continued to increase. Soon the water was rushing up at them like a gigantic blue-green wall. President Long reached over for Al and pulled him close. They rode out the last few hundred

feet clinging to each other for dear life, screaming at the top of their lungs in terror as they did so.

      In the last thirty feet of their fall, the brakes were gently applied, and they found themselves sitting a few inches above the water. Other than being scared out of their wits, they were entirely unscathed.

      "Well, this is awkward," the President said, as Al tried to extricate himself from his grasp. Eventually, President Long relented and released his friend. They sat side by side and examined the situation they found themselves in. They were on an invisible platform, with their legs stretched out before them. Tentatively, Al pushed his hand through the raft they appeared to be adrift upon, and touched the water.

"How the devil..." he said.

      "Ours is not to wonder why," President Long said. "All bets are off, at this point. Besides, Al, I'd keep my hands and feet out of the water."

      He indicated to their left with his chin, and they watched as the dorsal fin of a gigantic shark disappeared beneath the waves, only to resurface forty feet away a few seconds later. The fin had extended nearly eight feet out of the water.

      "What could that possibly be, Albert?" the President asked, using Al's full name for perhaps the first time ever.

      "Dragons, giant birds," Al said. "The only logical conclusion in my mind would be a Megalodon shark."

"Really? I never heard of that one. That was much bigger than a great
white."

"They're extinct. Or at least we think they are." "Think?"
      "They found a tooth in the Mariana Trench. Carbon dating showed it was only ten thousand years old. A lot of stuff died off around that time, but they could have survived. Besides," he said, "we thought Pterodactyls were extinct, too."

      They radioed their position to Hans, who was only twelve miles away. In the meantime, they became comfortable enough to turn around and look at the newly

formed island.

"What do you think is over there?" the President asked. "Bad mojo," Al replied.
      As if to underscore this, the head and neck of a plesiosaur broke the water in front of them.

� � �

      Dan tried to shift away from the trees and made a valiant effort, only to end up stuck ten feet in the air, hanging by a limb. But before he could begin the process of unbuckling the harness, there was a blur from the east, and then there stood Regina. Only she looked nothing like Regina. Still, Dan knew it was her.

"Regina," he said.

      At once he was on his way down, the parachute straps negated. On the ground, he made no move to embrace her, and she sensed his unease about her appearance.

      "I'm sorry," she said, and then Dan watched the tiny blonde morph slowly before his eyes into a brunette.

"Are you taller now?" he asked.

"A little," she said. "I didn't think you'd notice."

But Regina's old form was no longer her true self. It was a Regina disguise. "What's going on, Regina?"
"I don't know," she lied.

"Regina, you brought me here, I could feel it." She had no answer for him.
"Where are we?" he asked her.

"Rapture, soon to be Eden again." "What does that mean?"
No reply.

"So, why am I here?" "Fate."
"You brought me here. One way or another."

      "I am fate. I am She. I'm..." she searched for a way to describe things in mortal terms.

"I'm hacking the Earth."

"You need to stop, Regina. People are dying. Animals and trees are dying." "I have calculated the cost. It was a net gain."
      Dan struggled to find a way to get through to Regina and was finding it well nigh impossible.

      In answer to that, Regina said, "I can't hurt the planet because I am the planet."

      To illustrate, her entire body was tattooed with continents and oceans. Her feet poked into the ground like roots, and her hair grew leaves. She idly scratched her shoulder, and a few hundred people died from one disaster or another. Dan could sense these things, but it was more than that. The impressions he was receiving came across as indisputable. Regina had found absolute truth, or she was rapidly calculating it.

"I'm cataloging," she said. "What?"
      "I'm building a database of the things on Earth. Starting with people. A certain baseline standard will be determined, and those who are found lacking..." she trailed off.

Silence, other than the rushing winds that surrounded them.

"You can't be serious. You can't pick and choose, you can't play God." "I don't play," Regina said.
      She came down to his level, now a perfect reproduction, not only of Regina, but Regina as he knew her. How he remembered her.

Staring him in the eyes, she said, "People are a pestilence. Microbes on my
flesh."

      "You're crazy. That can't be true," Dan said, but he knew it was true, at least in a sense. He thought there was more to it than she was letting on. Or more to it that even she didn't know or understand.

      "The sorting algorithms are still being developed," she said, trying to be helpful.

      "Regina, you can't tell me a retarded person deserves life any less than anyone else."

      "In nature," Regina began "no one deserves anything. Except death. The one promise. These are new criteria. Mine."

"What about your father and uncle?"

"They're fine," she said.

� � �

      Al and the President did their best to relax and get comfortable. They admired the majestic neck of the plesiosaur, not to mention the rows of teeth in its fearsome mouth.

Hans broke in on the radio, "This is Hans, over." "Yeah?" Al said.
"I think I see sea serpents."

      "That's crazy," Al said, silently laughing along with the President. He gave him their coordinates, and told him to ignore the sea serpents. The Mary Celeste II arrived five minutes later, flanked on either side by what could only be described as water dragons. The crewmen helped the two castaways aboard as the monsters danced and frolicked around them. After they had stepped onto the scuba deck at the rear of the boat, the President leaned down to touch the invisible platform they had been floating on.

"It's gone," the President said. "It was never there," Al said.
      They went to the bridge to visit acting Captain Hans. His already pale Nordic skin glowed white, and his hands refused to leave the wheel. He stared straight ahead as he spoke. As if to underscore the absurdity of Han's selective perception, two of the beasts leapt over the ship in unison, crashing down with a splash that rocked them wildly, making it impossible to ignore.

      "Full steam ahead, Mr. Luker. Let's put some distance between us and this watery hell."

      "Aye, sir," Filthy said, "But what of the Captain? Never leave a man behind, he always says."

"He's with Regina. I'm sure he's fine."

                          � � � "Regina, untie me!" Dan shouted, fruitlessly.
      This was complicated by the fact that there were no restraints visible, but instead, tendrils from Regina's feet lightly held him in place. He couldn't see them, but he felt their caresses.

"Just please listen to me, Dan," Regina said exasperated. "Untie me," he said again.
      "Don't walk away from me this time," she said, and his bonds fell away instantly.

"I want to have a baby," she said. The words hung between them like a fog. "Uh," Dan said.
Clearly, the fog had set in.

      "Is that okay?" she eventually asked, trying to nudge him back into the conversation.

"With me?" he asked stupidly.

"Yes, of course with you, silly. Who else?" Dan returned to his vegetative state.
"Shouldn't we get married, first?" he managed to say.

"Oh, Dan. You're sweet. I'm afraid there will be no more marriages very
soon."

"What?"

      "Oh, just no paper marriages, Dan. People will still pair up and commit to each other. But now their commitments will have some meaning behind them. Love and devotion, not the state, will define the characteristics of future partnerships."

      "And who will keep track of these new marriages, Regina?" Dan asked, as if he had thought of something she hadn't.

"They will, silly. Duh."

He had to admit, she had a point there.

"Things will be different, soon. More efficient." "Better?" he asked.
"I don't know, Dan. I'm not omniscient." He raised his eyebrows.

"Aren't you? You certainly seem to have the power to move Heaven and
Earth."

"Technically all I moved was earth."

"And wiped out hundreds of thousands of people."

"Well, I'm sorry Dan. I'm new at this. Anyway, natural selection." "Natural selection?"
      "The coastline is not your optimal dwelling place if survival is paramount. I think that point has been illustrated nicely."
"We all appreciate it, Regina. Nature is unpredictable, we get it." "Everything's so...inefficient," she said, not listening. "People are so
entrenched in bureaucracy, it's holding back human evolution." "How is that even possible?" Dan asked.
      "Well, look at certain handicaps. Those people survive because their survival is guaranteed by legislation. Two hundred years ago, they would have died. Now they're breeding..." She shuddered. "It's not progress, Dan. We're backing up."

      "What happened to the sweet and innocent runaway of a few days ago?" Dan lamented.

"Once you get a view of the big picture, it changes you." "And not for the better, it seems."
"No, not for the better," she agreed.

      "But truth is truth. What is seen can't be unseen. Besides," she said brightly, "opportunities like this don't come along every day."

"Opportunities for what, Regina?"

"I'm going to remake the world in my image."

      Dan's eyes darted to the continents and oceans covering her flesh, and Regina read his thoughts. It was no small feat, as she could now listen to everyone's thoughts and sometimes the cacophony of background noise swelled in her head until she had to mentally turn the volume down on everyone.

"Not like that, Dan," Regina smiled.

He was imagining the planet being shaped like Regina.

      "I mean this planet is under new management. I'll be making a few changes around here."



Chapter 13 - The Proposal
      Hans was more than eager to leave his current latitude and longitude. In fact, he was beginning to think he'd be better off on dry land. Permanently. He engaged the forward thrusters and everything seemed to operate as it should. But after twenty minutes of travel, they'd only succeeded in circling the island.

      "Dagblastit, Hans, the scenery is starting to look familiar. Take us to the mainland," the President said.

"I'm trying, Captain."

      Hans checked and re-checked his instruments until finally, realization dawned on President Long.



yet."

"Forget it," he said softly. "It's Regina. I guess she doesn't want us to leave

� � �

A smile played across Regina's lips. She kept her father and uncle in orbit

around Eden until Dan was ready to leave. And he would be soon, she knew. Even if he himself was unsure.

"This baby thing..." he said finally. "Yes?" Regina said brightly.
"Um, are you sure?"

      "I am Dan. Are you?" She studied his eyes, although she could already see into his heart.

      "To be perfectly honest, Regina, I never intended to have any children. But then again, that was before I met you. And now all this... I don't think I could oppose or refuse you, could I?"

"Of course you can. It's free will. That's why I asked."

"Free will," he said, "That's rich, considering how I got here." "Nevertheless..." Regina said.
Dan sighed. "Then, yes, I accept your proposal." He paused. "So, when do
we-"

"We already did, Dan. Two days ago. Remember?" "So, you're already pregnant? What if I had said no?"
"Actually, I conceived when you said yes. Just now." She winked at him. "What?" he asked
"I sort of froze things. Call it suspended animation." "But, why?"
"Free will, Dan. The choice had to be yours."

      "I won't pretend to understand you, Regina. But it hardly seems fair that I don't get to make love to you on the day you conceive."

"Oh, Dan. I'm pretty sure it would kill you," she said.

And then he was back aboard the Mary Celeste II, looking bewildered.

� � �

      He took a few moments to regain his composure, and then strolled onto the bridge, where he was casually received.

      "Dan," the President said by way of a greeting. Al withheld his customary grunt in favor of a stony silence.

      "At ease, Hans," Dan said, noticing his intense discomfort. "I'll take it from here. Get some rest."

      "Yes, sir," he responded dutifully, never making eye contact as he staggered off to his quarters.

When the door closed behind him, Al snorted and said, "Well?" "You wouldn't believe me if I told you."
"Try me."

      "Okay. Regina has turned into a giant tree, but she's also the planet. We're but microbes on her flesh, and I think she wants us off. She's planning on making some changes, and she doesn't really seem to have a problem with all the death and destruction she caused."

"The hell you say," the President said, and knocked Dan's lights out.

      The next thing Dan knew, Al was waving smelling salts under his nose and slapping him on the cheek.

"Wake up, champ," he was saying.

When his eyes were open, he sat up, and looked around. "Sorry about that," the President said.
Dan looked him squarely in the eyes.

"And she's having my baby, and we're not getting married."

      He braced himself for another punch, but when he opened his eyes again, the President was studying him cautiously.

"A grandson?" he asked.

"I...I don't know. But she's definitely having a baby."

� � �

      Regina looked down and smiled. She placed her hand on her flat stomach and a baby bump grew under it. She began drawing trace elements to her, all the micronutrients necessary for fetal development. A few, like indium, were unknown to most expectant mothers.

      But Regina was no ordinary expectant mother. She was the only one on the planet. Gently, very gently, she had undone all the ongoing pregnancies in the world. She didn't terminate or miscarry them, but instead just slowly reversed them until they were once again sperm and ovum.

      Erasing their memories took a lot more work. She found it easier to simply make everyone forget than to concentrate only on the people affected. Only Dan, her father and uncle knew she was expecting, but they didn't know what to expect. Regina felt both impish and godlike at the same time and wondered if this was how Loki felt all the time.

      Then she caught herself. Loki? She wasn't sure where that came from. Loki was some Viking god of mischief, she recalled, not someone she went to school with.

      She idly peeked in at the tabulations, which were relegated to background processes as she devoted most of her attention to her new baby. The trouble, she found, was that there were so many gray areas in life. Initially, she thought that judging the qualities of a man's soul was straightforward: good or evil.

      In many cases, that was true. But there were always exceptions. Even with murder, you could not develop a blanket rule to cover every situation. Certainly, some murders were justified. Theft was a huge moral quandary. Oftentimes, people were stealing from companies and employers that also seemed to be stealing from them.

      Only rape never seemed to be justified. Except as punishment for rape, she supposed. But there were women who said "no" but meant "yes." Did it count if you only thought you raped someone? Or what if a woman claimed she had been raped, but lied?

      Regina was confident she could sort out these issues, but it was going to take more time and resources than she had planned. By the time she noticed, it was too late. The baby, her baby, had doubled in size. Regina had to pull back from her calculating and focus all of her seemingly limitless power on slowing the growth of the newly awakened consciousness now self-assembling inside her.

      Regina could feel the child's mind trying to form, heedless to any will of man or law of nature.

"Slow down Tommy," she whispered, patting herself on the stomach.

� � �

      Now that Regina had released the ship, and a traumatized Hans was safely sequestered in bed, they found it was extremely smooth sailing. Although each detail appeared to be perfect, the trip took on an air of unreality. Al and the President ignored this aspect. But Dan, having met the face of madness, couldn't help but question all that he thought he knew.

"Where to, boss?" he asked his new father-in-law.

"Eh?" the President answered distractedly. "Doesn't really matter at this
point."

      Dan still didn't know what the rest of the planet did: all forms of electronic communication had been halted. Word of mouth, local video such as tapes or DVDs, and the written word were the only options available, turning the ordinary hierarchy of information on its head. For once, the world leaders were dictated to by the masses. But Regina couldn't keep things at a standstill forever.

      He elected to return to the scene of the crime. All roads lead to Reykjavik, he thought glumly. About forty miles from shore, he began to make out a shape looming over the landmass. A gigantic glowing hourglass slowly poured sand from one end of itself to the other. It currently seemed to coincide with the day/night cycle of the area, but the implication was clear: time was running out.

      Back in Reykjavik, an eerie silence engulfed the city. It was the second disaster to befall them of late. The power and water worked, but the lack of electronic communication pushed everyone out into the streets. The air was thick with excitement, mingled with a measure of fear, more so in some than others. The overall effect was positive. There was a real sense of community, now. A common foe, Dan thought. The oldest trick in the book.

      He had assumed that without the power to broadcast, the media wouldn't be interested in their arrival. He was wrong. Even in this modern age, they all seemed to have newsie DNA, and had reverted to print journalists. All decorum was lost as they shouted questions at the President.

"Mr. President! Mr. President!" "Hey!"

"Mr. President, when will you restore telecommunications?"

"Mr. President, what about the coastal residents around the world?"

      "Mr. President, isn't it true that your own daughter is responsible for what's happening?"

With the last comment, the room grew silent.

"Now that's just crazy, that's... not... poss...i...ble..."

      He grew silent as every face and every mind screamed out with the truth of it. Regina, somehow, was responsible for everything happening around the world. A small voice broke the silence.

"Couldn't you, you know, talk to her for us?" Everyone hung on the President's breath. "She wouldn't allow me to enter-" "Rapture!" a person called out.
"No, it's Eden!" another proclaimed.

There were loud murmurs of conflicting voices.

      "Whatever that place is called, Atlantis, it's currently off-limits to me. As soon as I can put a stop to these goings on, I will. In the meantime, let's remember not to panic."

      Again, a clamor of voices arose, drowning out everyone's thoughts. While the assembled reporters and concerned citizens argued their supposed fate, Al said, "No more questions," and pushed the President through a side door. Dan followed



Chapter 14 - In an Icelandic McDonald's
Regina was manipulating the constellations themselves.

      The knowledge continued to pour into her. From where, she longer knew. She had thought she understood at some points. Now she knew she did not. If Earth was the computer that she had access to manipulate, that would be one thing. Her powers seemed to exceed even that. She could feel the energy course through her being and began to draw stars closer to Earth. She drew the moon closer still.

      The forces of the sun, moon, and stars acted on her baby, the only baby in existence.

� � �

      Curiously, once they had gotten away from the media, Dan, Al, and President Long seemed to exist in a bubble. By virtue of timing, they almost never got closer than ten or fifteen feet to anyone they saw, unless they actively pursued them. Oftentimes the people they did interact with seemed confused and disoriented.
"I have to see a newspaper," Dan said as they prowled the empty streets. "What in blazes for, Dan?" the President snapped. "Hell in a handbasket, and
I'm somehow to blame." He rethought this, "We're somehow to blame." "I'm not so sure. How could we have stopped it?"
"We could have done things differently."

      Flummoxed, Dan abandoned his halfhearted pursuit of logic. "A newspaper," he repeated.

      Al had ceased verbal communication, sarcasm now too taxing for him, but he gestured down the street to the left, where a McDonalds, of all things, stood. It looked out of place among the cobblestone streets, yet at the same time entirely natural.

      They pushed the door open, feeling the coolness of the air that was entirely different than the coolness of the air outside, although there was no difference in

temperature. Dan knew what he would find there, and wasn't disappointed: a new edition of USA Today.

� � �

      Tommy faced a conundrum. He needed to grow to communicate more effectively, but he couldn't grow faster than Regina wanted him to, if he wasn't going to blow his cover. Still, he had managed to manipulate Dan to a degree already. But he didn't have a firm handle on getting any real message to him. His consciousness floated in empty space, and he reached back into the past.

� � �

      Dan ignored the headlines, which were the same sort of cryptic gibberish he'd long ago learned to tune out. But things that once seemed impossible to him now weren't even improbable. He expected to find a USA Today where none should exist. Of course the headlines would be odd.

"South Braces for Hurricane Regina," one read.

      Dan's largely untethered mind interpreted that as, "The wildly unpredictable forces of creation have temporarily been curtailed by the mass implantation of micro I.U.D.s."

      Curiously, there was no mention of ongoing events as last he understood them, and that somehow made sense too. No need to scare the sheep. The battle would be conducted all around them as they slept on.

� � �

      Tom released his grip on consciousness, at last letting go and giving control back to the overmind. Or as Tom thought of it, the vast, unblinking eye in which we were all reflected. But as he rushed off to the other place we go when we're not here, he realized it was instead the overmind giving up control of him.

      "You're trying too hard," his mama said. And she was his mama, now. He had created her so she could create him. But she only thought he was trying to grow, not master time and space before he was even born.

� � �

      The paper was frustrating to Dan. He felt silly looking for clues in a newspaper, like some cold war spy or double agent. And yet... There was definitely something amiss. It was more than a regular news blackout. He understood how it was possible that an edition of USA Today was thrown together last night, zapped electronically to Iceland to appear in an out-of-place McDonalds. But it didn't seem likely.

      He would have found it more convincing if the headlines screamed about the disasters befalling the world. Instead, it seemed like business as usual. Just as he was about to ball the paper up in disgust, a small article caught his eye.

      The words "Captain Dan" jumped out at him, at first. Then he read "help Tom" and the hairs on his neck stood up. Then he saw, "save Reg-" Frantically he turned to 6A for the continuation of the story, but the word was "Reggie" not Regina.

      Undaunted, he read the entire article, this time not trying to make sense of it. It was about a place off of Nova Scotia named Oak Island. Dan had heard of it. Sailors had lots of time, and loved to tell stories. And this one qualified as a ghost story. Perhaps a better story than the Mary Celeste, which was still the all-time favorite ghost story with sailors.

      As the tale is told, a young boy noticed a depression in the sand beneath an oak. His head filled with visions of pirate treasure, he gets a shovel and begins to dig. He digs a pit a full ten feet into the sand whereupon he strikes an oaken platform. Convinced that he has struck the top of a treasure chest, he opens the wood to reveal...nothing. Undaunted, he continued his excavation. At twenty feet, he felt the same elation followed by the same disappointment. At thirty and forty feet, the same. At fifty feet, now two months into digging, he abandoned his efforts. Some say he aged fifty years in that time.

      Since then others have leased the land, or backed adventures, in hopes of acquiring whatever fabulous treasure lie waiting there. Each expedition had failed, and several have died in the attempt. At nearly two hundred feet deep, each new platform revealed new pitfalls. Many say that land is cursed. Others believe it to be hallowed.

      For him, the tale was always allegorical. A young boy at play in what is essentially paradise becomes obsessed with wealth, and the power wealth holds. Instead of treasuring his youth, he squanders it in a vain pursuit.

Leave well enough alone, Dan thought. Let sleeping gods lie.

      Where did that come from, he wondered. He received another metaphorical thought regarding the parable of Oak Island, that of spiritual metaphor. He saw it as the pursuit of God. People stumble upon hidden treasure but abandon their efforts if the payoff isn't immediate, relegating themselves to a lifetime of loneliness and confusion.

That thought depressed Dan more than the first one.

"We have to get to Oak Island, Nova Scotia," he finally said aloud.

� � �

      Regina was aware that they were going, but couldn't discern why, since Dan himself didn't know. She kept an eye on them because they were her family more so than because of on any concern that they could upset her plans. She'd moved Heaven and Earth and created life. What could possibly go wrong?

      She reconsidered what he had said about making love to her. At first, she's been so enthralled with her newfound powers that she ignored ordinary human desires like food, water, rest, and sex. She found that she could satisfy most of her physical body's needs via concentration alone. She could even give herself mental orgasms. But it seemed lonely and wrong.

      So she began to eat and drink again, and the planet celebrated. She refused to sleep, however. The old ways really are the best ways, she thought, once more turning her mind to Dan. Perhaps she had overestimated her powers. Regina reconsidered his somewhat romantic notion of conception and thought that she owed him at least that much. She had his son, after all.

                          � � � The President looked at Dan dumbly.
      Al said, "Of course." There was no hint of sarcasm in his voice. Both looked at him incredulously. "I'm, ah, getting messages. You?"

He looked at Dan and the President hopefully.

      "I think so," Dan said. "Vague ones. Like, I never read the paper, much less USA Today. But I gave into a strange urge and bought this." He motioned to the

article, which he had highlighted in a few places.

      Al read it and grunted. "Mmm, Tom," he said, as if that answered everything. The President followed Al, but said nothing. Neither man turned the page.

"Tom is the baby's name," Dan said to the President. "Baby's name?" the President asked. "It's two days old." "I'm pretty sure it's a lot older than that," Al said.
Dan didn't disagree.

      "How come you're not picking up on these things?" he asked President Long. "I have a connection through her, to a degree, and more so with Tom, who is partly mine."

"Partly?" the President asked, but he received no explanation.

      "Al seems to have a solid link. So by any logic, you should have the strongest, most direct line to Regina herself. So why not? Could she be shielding you?"

      "Me? No. She knows I'm utterly impotent now. I always was, come to think about it. I had great visions of upsetting the apple cart and making everything right, somehow. She just beat me to it."

"Tell 'em," Al said.

� � �

      Regina hit an anomaly in her categorizing and sorting of the planet's inhabitants. While looking at lineages and backtracking ancestors, Regina began to examine herself. Plain as day, she was listed as a murderer, among other things.

� � �

"I'm not Regina's father," President Long said. "What?" Dan said. "My jaw still hurts."

      "Oh, she effectively is my daughter. She doesn't know any better. But Al here is her actual, biological father. Of course, we both raised her."

"So are you two...?" Dan had to ask. "Heck, no. Dan, you should know better." "Then what?"
      "Then, well, Regina's mother and I used to have all kinds of fun. Al here had a wife then, too. They died together."

"But we got Regina," Al said, not as lightly as he'd hoped.

� � �

      Regina was taking in the same information at the same time. "Oh," was all she could bring herself to say about the matter. It didn't change anything, she still loved them both. But it did explain why her father seemed more closed off to her than Uncle Al. She had attributed it to her mother dying.

      Mother. Regina felt if she tried hard she could see her. She knew her molecules were in each breath she took, in each mote of dust, each drop of rain. It helped, some. Regina felt that if she tried very hard, she could reassemble her. She caught herself. Raise the dead? What was she thinking? But it was too late. What seemed a universe of lost souls cried out to Regina at once, "Yes, release us!"

      She passed out where she stood, and the sunlight filtering through the trees dappled her pregnant, naked body. As she slept, her stomach grew.



Chapter 15 - Meet Bjork
      "We have to get to the embassy," the President said, hailing a cab. None of the them spoke Icelandic, but he repeated the word embassy, and the driver seemed to understand. Twenty minutes later and they were in that unmistakable part of big cities, the international section populated by U.N. offices, consulates and the offices of ambassadors galore.

      When they disembarked, Al tried to give the driver an American fifty, but he refused, instead shaking his smiling head as he drove away.

� � �

      Tommy seized his opportunity. Regina had curtailed his growth even as she slept, but now that she was unconscious, he redoubled his previous efforts and was rewarded for doing so. By the time she had awakened, he was the equivalent of five months old, and was viable even now. When she opened her eyes and understood, Regina put the brakes on so fast both she and her baby cried out in pain.

"Oh, Tommy," she said, "You brat..."

� � �

      The American embassy was cool and somewhat dark, but there was a receptionist sitting in a puddle of light.

"I need to send a cable. I'm the President of the United States."

      The receptionist, a bored waif with an angular haircut, twirled her finger in the air, wordlessly saying "I'm really impressed", unimpeded by the language barrier. She pulled a form from her desk, and handed him a pen, as well.

President Long accepted them and sniffed, "She could have at least asked for
I.D."

"Maybe she's glanced at a Newsweek in the past two years," Dan suggested.

      The message was short and sweet: "Send the fifth fleet to Reykjavik, Iceland. The President."

Twenty or so minutes later, they received a reply.

      "Sir, all military planes, ships and vehicles are currently immobile. We fear an imminent attack. Please advise."

The President issued a single, two-word edict in reply: "Man up."

      He drafted a longer, more involved cable and this time sent it to Renee Hollander, owner of Zen Construction, an international construction company that tackled only the biggest projects.

He got his reply in a hurry: "Twenty-four hours."

� � �

      True to her word, Renee's vessel arrived twenty-four hours later, accompanied by two more huge cargo ships. On the deck of one was a triple eight Manitowoc crane. Al, Dan and the President stood on the beach at the coordinates provided to her on the previous day. She drove ashore in an inflatable raft propelled by an outboard engine. The President stepped forward to help her over the edge.

      When she had both feet in the sand, she leaned forward, wrapped both arms around his shoulders, and gave him a kiss that lasted between ten and a thousand seconds.

"I surrender," the President said. "Finally," Renee said. "How are you?"
"I've never been better, and things have never been worse."
"Tell me about it. At least some things never change. You look great." "Pshaw. I'm getting a little gray around the temples. It's probably the
trappings of power you're attracted to."

"Oh, absolutely," she said and grinned. "What?"

"It was a pun."

The President looked at her blankly. "Lord Acton?"
"Eh?"

"Power corrupts? Absolute power corrupts absolutely?" "I'm not sure I believe in absolutes now."
"Oh, absolutely. Vodka?"

The President accepted both the pun and flask without question.

"So," she began after taking another pull herself. "Tell me, I'm curious.
What are we doing here?"

"I have no earthly idea," the President said.

Dan, who had been listening attentively, stepped in.

      "I can't tell you," he said smiling, "because I don't know myself. I know we need to dig a hole. We'll figure out the rest after that."

      Hans walked up at that moment. "Captain, we have company," he said, pointing toward the water. A number of Canadian Mounties were approaching in a ragtag collection of boats.

      Renee spoke a few words into a walkie-talkie, and her men began to pour out of all three ships. The construction workers began to form a line between the two parties. When the Mounties reached that point, they didn't fight or talk. Instead the line opened up and allowed them to pass through to Dan, Renee and the President. When they had passed, the line closed back again, leaving them surrounded and outnumbered.

"Who's in charge here?" the lead Mountie demanded.

"I am," the President and Renee both said at the same time.

"Well, what's your business here?" "We're here to dig a hole," Renee said.
      "Oak Island," the Mountie began, "is a national historic preserve. We can't allow treasure hunters to come in here willy-nilly. There is a procedure. Leases must be procured."

"We're not treasure hunters," Renee said. She looked at Dan. "Are we?" "No," Dan said. "At least I don't think so."
      "Be that as it may," the lead Mountie said, "This is sovereign Canadian territory. You...will...not...pass."

      He looked at them intently for a moment and then grinned. "Gandolf? Lord of the Rings? Balrog? Anybody?"

      The President joined the discussion. "Listen, son. I know what you mean about territoriality. It hurts me to do this, because it flies in the face of my ideals. But we can do this the easy way, or the fun way."

"What about the hard way?" "That is the fun way."
Renee gave a whistle, and eighty fists rose up in a defensive gesture. "Be reasonable, son," the President said, "You're Canadians."
It was all the lead Mountie could do to not fall victim to the taunting. "Okay," he said, "let's talk."
      Thirty minutes later, a composite crew including members of both parties began unloading construction equipment.

      "I always wondered what was down there, anyway," the lead Mountie confided.

� � �

      Unnerved by Tommy's rapid growth, Regina was reluctant to break her concentration. But she had an experiment that she wanted to try. He seemed to still be asleep, although she wasn't sure she could trust her feelings where he was concerned. Tentatively, she released as much control of him as she dared. He didn't seem to grow any faster when she did so.

      Regina entered their dreams. It was still too dangerous to do with conscious people, but this was safe enough. She didn't want any repeat accidents like when she moved Rapture. Some four billion people opened their eyes at once. While their bodies slept, each dreamed that they saw the room they were in fade away, followed by the house and finally the land surrounding it.

      Their minds floated in open space, seeing the galaxy in a way no photo or film could express. It was a feeling that was somehow extra-religious and universal. Then Regina spun their views around to the sun. Despite the lack of shielding, it didn't hurt to look at it in a dream, at least. When every mind was focused, the sun exploded, and each awoke in their beds, unable to return to sleep.

� � �

      Renee's platoon of workers unloaded enough supplies for a small city. After an hour or so, the outline of that small city began to emerge.

      "Move that fuel tank!" she was yelling over the rumble of the equipment, "We need room for the excavator!"

      They constructed a few hooches and lean-tos, some connected, some freestanding, and the President and Al sat on metal folding chairs while they rested their feet.

      "I'm sorry," she told them, "they work much better if they don't think of me in an air-conditioned office."

"In my day, women didn't wear pants," Al said.

      "Sounds like a sexy party, pops," Renee said, sticking her tongue out at him. "But I wear the pants around here. Say, how much dynamite are we going to need?"

The President looked alarmed.

      "Dynamite? Hopefully, none," he said. And then he remembered what Dan had said about the rock underneath, and the tunnels. "Better bring just a case."

      "Two cases of dynamite!" she yelled out to no one in particular and grinned. But that evening the President noted there were two crates labeled "TNT" outside of her combination office/bedroom.

      Tommy had commenced communication with Regina, having reached the physical age of six months in just under a week. But he did this to distract her from what was going on at Oak Island.

      "Hello. Regina," his voice said in her head. "Long time, no see. It seems like only a few days ago, you were murdering me, and now here we are, mother and son."

She didn't want to respond. "I think I made a mistake," she said. "Which one?"
Regina withdrew without answering.

      The next morning at the camp there was no horn or whistle, but everyone awoke at dawn as if by agreement. The workers sipped coffee and ate doughnuts as they made preparations to begin the day. As the excavator was moved into position, Dan and Renee talked about the specifics of what needed to occur.

      "The excavator will reach down thirty feet, no more. We're already going to be closer to the edge of the pit than we should be. I haven't lost a man yet. I don't intend to start now."

"Okay, but we're looking at two-hundred feet or so to bedrock," he said.

      She led him over to a laydown area, where various pieces of equipment and materials sat on pallets.

      "That's what this is for," she said, and gestured toward an item he hadn't noticed before. By the treeline was a flat black set of metal teeth the size of a Volkswagon.

      "This thing will dig down to three-hundred feet," Renee said, "Provided there are no impediments. The question is, do we finesse it, or do we use brute force?"

"Huh?"

      "Well," she said, "We could gingerly dig down foot by foot, chronicling everything we see and find along the way..."

"Or?" Dan asked.

      "I don't usually do things gingerly," she said. "I'm the Skipper." She paused for effect. "Or Mary Ann with attitude," she said, revealing a stick of dynamite. "It'd go a lot quicker if we just blast everything loose and then scoop it out with the crane."

      Dan was torn. On one hand, he knew that this mystery's solution should be documented for the ages. On the other hand, people around the world were getting increasingly nervous about the future. Dan expected them to reach the tipping point in the next week or so.

"Blast it," Dan said. "Dagnabit," Renee returned.
"No, seriously. Time is of the essence. Do what you have to do..."

      Renee stared into his eyes and for a moment she loved him. Then she lit a fuse, and held the stick of dynamite in her hand.

"You probably want to run away, now," she said.

      Dan turned and began to do so. Renee casually tossed the stick over her shoulder and followed him. The explosion was deafening. A ton of sand rose up and began to rain down on the area. Renee walked back to the pit. "Move this loose sand and then bring the triple eight. And my dynamite," she added.

� � �

      While the President snored on, oblivious to the explosions, Al sat at his desk in a trance.

      "Hello, Grandpa," Tommy said. "We're going to need to work together if we're going to put things back the way they were."

"Who are you?" Al thought.

      "Regina's baby. Tommy. The truth is much stranger. What matters now is getting Dan into that control room."

Al grunted in his head.

"It'll make sense at the right time," he said, somewhat patronizingly. Al's hands began to draw an isometric map of the Oak Island money pit.



Chapter 16 - Goddesshead
      The forces at work inside of Regina were manifesting in the exterior world as storms. This, she thought, is why I had to put things on hold for a while. Millions of mothers and babies making storms. But that wasn't really the case, was it?

      By process of elimination, there had to be a solipsistic universe for each of us. She just happened to have found hers. So in a sense, a butterfly flapping its wing across the ocean was now just a butterfly, not a chaos engine. On the other hand, what she did affected the Earth in a big way, and not all of it seemed to be under her direct control. South Braces for Hurricane Regina. She had to smile at the headline. Now she knew Tommy had generated it after he was reconceived.

      "Judas," the thought entered her head. "Betrayed with a kiss." The voice wasn't Tom's, but it was Tom all the same.

      "You knew everything," she said to him. "Before you even kidnapped me, you knew the outcome. Why, then?"

Silence was his reply.

� � �

      In between blasts, a scaffold leading down into the pit was being constructed.

"That's eighty feet," Renee said. "How far are we going?"

      "At one hundred twenty feet we should hit the first flood tunnel. I think. It's kinda hard with no Internet. This sort of thing isn't handled well by Britannica."

      "Let me ask you this, Dan," she said, "If this has been dug up before, why is the digging so hard that we need dynamite?"

      "Renee, I no longer question much. In my limited experience, the reasons for our being here will be something other than we think."

"So keep digging," she said.

Dan nodded.

"Fire in the hole," she yelled, and dropped another stick down the well.

      The world writhed uncomfortably in an uneasy dream. They moved with the knowledge that their lives were whimsical fantasy, yet at the same time unable to resist the reassuring siren song of tightly structured reality. Regina eliminated things like rent and bills, and people simply re-imagined them. They went on making money that didn't exist to pay bills that no longer needed paying. Food arrived by the truckloads everywhere, and people dutifully asked no questions, standing in line for the privilege of applying for a job as a stock person.

      She understood. For her, Eden. Heaven. She was living the dream, so to speak. For the rest, Hell. Rapture, at best. Limbo. Because if you weren't living in her dream, you were living in your nightmare. But only because they couldn't yet accept her version of reality. And her version of reality didn't come cheap. The price of admission was intangible. If it had to be hell, she was the chief devil-in-charge.

      The people themselves, now abstractions to Regina, began to wear their politics on their faces, their exteriors reflecting an inner peace or chaos, knowing acceptance or fearful denial, as their tattered inner belief systems dictated. History was a prison, she reflected. Her overall plan (it was hers, it had to be hers) was gaining cohesion. Rather than play fast and loose with what seven billion people considered truth, she simply emphasized some facts and ideas over others.

      All she did was shine a spotlights on aspects of the cultures that were already there. The east. Enlightenment. Atlanta. Atlantic. Atlantis.

      To the Indians of North America, she was Manitou, the great white buffalo, the she-wolf who ran with the moon. To the Indians of India, she was Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Kali. To the Jews, Muslims and Christians alike, she was the messiah formerly known as Jesus Christ. The Buddhists didn't believe in a Buddha as such, so they were more difficult to manipulate. They did like to party, however, and that made them more, not less, receptive to epiphenomenon than the rest.

      And the atheists, deists, agnostics and gnostics? They all took it well enough. Since they were for the most part firm believers in the five senses, they couldn't easily rationalize away miracles. The poor gnostics, their numbers pitifully

small, lost all relevance, their unique positions now subsumed as everyone gained a close personal relationship with God.

      It was all good on her end. Or so she told herself. But she knew there was another her doing her bidding. A bidding so dark, she wouldn't allow herself knowledge of it. She decided it was a male impulse, that part of her she couldn't see or feel. A dark male aspect of her persona that did the unspeakable things in the night that allowed her to cheerfully carry on with her counting, sorting, tallying and gestating.

      But she did get glimpses. They came to her as the thoughts of those nameless, faceless others. She caught glimpses of how they viewed her. Occasionally a stray thought reached through the non-thought cloud she resided in. It was easier for her to work without fragile complications like emotions muddying the water.

      They didn't all think of her as God, who did no wrong in their eyes, nor Mother Nature, who was callous and destructive, even murderous, but somehow also blameless and benevolent. In the eyes of a great many, Regina was the devil, no more and no less. Once she got used to the concept, she embraced it. She didn't have the resources to manipulate every event on Earth, but she could see enough to understand the underlying mechanics. The vast majority of them pursued their aimless ends and were thwarted at every turn. Each disappointment drove them further toward her goals. The physical universe demanded motion.

      A much smaller contingent, possessing a quality she could not discern, had every advantage in life. Whatever they did, it came easily to them. And it didn't seem to be piety or a wholesome lifestyle that enabled them to live without struggle. Some of them were decidedly living outside the bounds of conventional morality. There seemed to be a sub-network that she wasn't fully privy to, a clique of insiders who lacked self-awareness but went right ahead operating as if they were working from a script. It was puzzling, and Regina didn't care for puzzles.

� � �

      It was slow going once they got past one hundred feet. The scaffold builders followed the excavation down, installing shoring against the sand that wanted to enclose them. When they hit the first flood tunnel, things began to get hairy.

      "Back that crane another fifty feet!" Renee was yelling as people scrambled to get out of her way. The tunnel was filling up with water, causing the sides around

the scaffold to collapse into their excavation. With each scoop of sand, three more fell in.

      "Son of a bitch!" Renee threw her sun visor, which she wore in lieu of a hardhat. A pity, as hardhats threw much more satisfyingly than your average visor. Unless, perhaps, you played a lot of tennis, which she did not.

"Rig up to the scaffold," she called out to one of her hands.

      They wore nothing to identify their respective crafts, but Renee seemed to know each of their functions. Dan later found out that she only hired cross- disciplined journeymen, capable of concrete, iron, pipe, electrical and all of the requisite supporting crafts. When the shackles had been attached she gave the crane operator the signal to lift. As he cabled up no more than an inch, the berm they had erected around the pit collapsed, leaving the top part of the scaffold floating unsupported in the air.

Renee sounded an air horn.

"Break time!" she shouted. "To hell with this!"

      Beers began to sail through the air. The President strode into the midst of the calamity, looking refreshed. Renee was in full-on battle mode.

"Move that shoring out of the way! North. North! Damn!"

"Maybe this will help," he said to Renee, handing her Al's drawing. "What the hell is this?" she shouted in his face.
"I would expect you to know," the President remarked casually.

      The challenge to her expertise caused Renee to stop and take notice. She snatched the drawing from him and furrowed her brow. Realization broke across her face.

"That's a blueprint," she blurted.

"I thought it might help. Al drew it and fell back asleep." "Balls," Renee said, exasperated.

      She grabbed an airhorn and sounded it for a full thirty seconds, until all work had ceased.

"Pack up our stuff. We're going home," she said.

      Renee walked to the north of the collapsed pit and then a few yards past. She pushed an orange-flagged stake into the ground.

      "Dig there," she told Dan. "The entrance is ten feet down. Here's four shovels."

Renee turned to the President. "Here's a bill for two million dollars." She turned to leave.
"Wait!" the President yelled. "Don't you want to see how things turn out?"

      "Not really," she said. "I have my own projects, you know. We're building the largest something or other near New Zealand, soon."

      The President knew better than to argue with her. It would lead to a spanking, and then neither of them would get anything accomplished.

      "Thank you, Renee. I'm not sure I could have done this without you," he said, and gave her a kiss on the cheek.

"Oh, I'm pretty sure you could have. But why didn't you show me the map
first?"

"Al just drew it. He doesn't even remember doing it. Some kind of trance." "Ooh! Did he use a Ouija board or something?"
      "Autowriting," he said, and shuddered. In a lowered voice, the President said, "And reading the bible..."

Renee raised her eyebrows.

"Not my rational Al? Scientific, atheistic Al?"

      "Rennie, if you've seen and done the things we have, your belief system becomes at best patches and band-aids. You should stay. I promise it will be interesting."

"Robby, I'd love to, you know that. But I have a bun in the oven, and-" "Wait, what?"
      "Oops, sorry. By that, I mean I have a new project to plan. My baby. I already lost two days by coming here. Besides," she said. "You and I would get back to our old ways. I'd never work again."

She smiled sadly.

"That doesn't sound so bad," he said.

      "Maybe not to you, but I can't stand still for long. Besides, the world really needs...whatever it is I build."

"Well, I'm too old for teary goodbyes," he said, extending his hand. "Thank you, Robert. I wouldn't do this for anyone else, you know." "I do know," he said. "And I appreciate it."
      "Tell Al I can always use him as a draftsman. And good luck with you boys' treasure hunt."

"Heh. I will. Thanks again."

She walked to the skiff and turned to wave one last time.

"Hurry up and get that stuff loaded," she yelled at her men. "I'm going take
a nap."

      Dan and the President looked at each other and then turned their collective glare on Al, who was sleepily joining their silent palaver.

"What?" he grunted.

      They turned their attention to the spot Renee had marked. A rash of Mounties were vying for the right to dig and already the sand from the excavation was beginning to pile up.

"Now what, indeed," the President said to Dan. "We'll know in a few minutes," was his reply.



Chapter 17 - The Money Pit
      As the Mounties dug, singing ancient songs of the sea, Al, Dan and the President pooled their known information.

      "Okay, so we know Tom is coming back," Dan said. "The question is, is this a good or a bad thing?"

"The devil you know..." Al said.

      "My daughter is not the devil!" the President exclaimed. He looked around nervously. "I guess I am."

      "Don't flatter yourself," Dan grinned. "You only kill flies because you think that's what you want. So you wanted to feed, clothe and house the country via some backdoor, slight-of-hand Karl Hess method. It was a noble cause. And I think it might have worked."

      "Until Regina made it all redundant," Al said, clapping his hand on his oldest pal's shoulder. "Don't take it so hard."

"Hey!" a Mountie shouted. "We're aboot there!"

      The three erupted into gales of laughter. It stopped when a voice boomed from everywhere "None shall pass..." as the first shovel struck a stainless steel barrier. A cheer arose from the contingent of redcoats, and their activities intensified. But the more they dug, the larger the plate became. They threw the dirt they excavated toward the previous hole, and when they dug in that direction, it too was covered by the plate of flawless metal.

"Impossible," the President scoffed.

"Right," Al said through the haze of a freshly lit cigar. "Like everything
else..."

"The question is, and I hate to belabor the obvious, how do we get in?" Dan
said.

      "Stop digging," the President ordered. He turned to face Dan and Al. "However we get there, it won't involve shovels."

Al shrugged. "I did my part," he said, referring to the map. "I have an idea," Dan said. "But I'm not sure how to use it."
      "What is it?" Al asked, somewhat interested in hearing what Dan had to say, for a change.

      "Here's the thing," Dan said. "I know there's some sort of access code or password, but I don't know what it is." He scratched his head and shrugged his shoulders.

      "You'd better think of something fast. First you lose my daughter..." the President said.

"Our daughter," Al said quietly.

"And then you turn her into some power-mad monster." Dan sat down and made designs in the sand with a stick.
"I'm getting an idea. It's kind of odd, but I guess I'm used to that by now.
First, does the date or equation 'nine seven eleven' mean anything to you?"

      "Nothing significant comes to mind," the President said. "Besides, that was a long time ago, anyway."

"If it's an equation, it depends on how you set it up," Al said. "Huh?" Dan had to ask.
"If it's an equation, are you using dashes or slashes as separators?" "I didn't think of that."
"So let's work it both ways," Al told him.

      Dan did some basic math. "I think we can eliminate division," he said. "It's some super-small decimal number. We'll keep it as a last resort. The other way, you

get negative nine, which makes some sense. I don't know how you would input it as a code or anything, though."

      Al, really getting back to his old self, grunted. "Kinda moot without a way to input a code..."

"Worse yet, I'm also getting this equation: Zee equals Zee squared plus
Cee."

      "Mandelbrot," Al said, and then went quiet again. He saw the impatient expectation on their faces, so he elaborated further without prompting. "Benoit Mandelbrot worked for IBM, and they gave him a sabbatical. Two years with pay. That equation was the output. Or, rather, he used their computers to visualize the equation. The result is known as the Mandelbrot Set, and it led us to fractal geometry and storage."

      "Dan, I think you're over-thinking this. In case you haven't noticed, things aren't exactly one hundred percent rational anymore," the President said.

"If they ever were," Dan replied.

      "Right. So you're faced with an impenetrable barrier without an entry point, and an equation with unknown variables. In such a case, quit trying so hard. Assign an arbitrary value to Zee. Zero sounds good."

"But zero squared-"

      "Sshhh," the President continued. "As for Cee, oh, count the number of cricket chirps in the next minute."

"Cricket ch-"

      Dan was interrupted by the sound of a tiny insect violinist warming up his instrument.

Al checked his watch. "That's one," he said.

      They all sat in breathless, mystified silence for fifty seconds. Then there was another chirp, and Al called time. "Cee is assigned a value of two," he said.

The cricket sounded a third time and then fell silent forever.

"Future event," Al said. "Didn't count."

      "Well, there you have it," the President said. "Zero squared plus two either equals two, or is impossible to solve. I can't recall, and I'm not sure it matters. So, let's test the theory," he said, and pushed Dan over the edge of the sand, where he fell to the stainless steel plate and promptly disappeared.

"That wasn't so hard, was it?" the President said, smiling at Al.

� � �

      Dan saw this happen more slowly than did his compatriots. As he approached the steel, a black hole opened up in it, causing him to think of nothing so much as The Beatles' "Yellow Submarine". I've got a 'ole in me pocket, he thought as he plunged into the unknown. He landed on his feet with the barest of impact, in an illuminated cavern lit by a phosphorescent glow that came from strata interwoven through what appeared to be obsidian.

"Nice..." he remarked to himself.

      He wandered around directionless and saw nothing further until the cavern itself seemed to grow dissatisfied with his aimlessness and instead lit a path for him to follow. It led Captain Dan to a simple oaken chest that looked like nothing so much as pirate treasure. As he approached it, its appearance changed. It thrummed with the undercurrents of hidden power, and the wood became ceramic, embossed with either ancient or alien hieroglyphics. For the first time in a long while, Dan actually felt a tinge of trepidation. Nevertheless, he reached out to open the box.

      The box saved him the worry and effort. Instead, it opened itself with a comical creaking sound. Inside, anti-climatically, was a handwritten note. It read: "Hi! Congratulations on discovering the lost Ark of the Covenant. I'm sorry you weren't vaporized as you ordinarily would have been, but you're sort of important to the plot. See you in eight seconds. - Tom".

      Eight seconds later Dan was face to face with himself as a child on an empty expanse of beach.

"Dan! Good to see you," young Dan said in an unlikely deep voice. "Tommy?" Dan asked skeptically.

      "I'm impressed, Dan. It's been a very long time since anyone's made it this far. Bravo."

Dan wasn't sure whether to be flattered or insulted.

"What's up with that box?" was the first thing he could think of to say.

      "Oh, that? Some ancient alien energy weapon. No big whoop. Used to be, you'd sneak that into a city and leave. When some poor fool finds it and opens it, bam! Everybody dies. Kinda like a neutron bomb, I guess. A killer Trojan horse, you could say."

"And now?"

      "Oh, now it's just an amusing cultural artifact. A reminder of the past. There's no longer a need for it. We've developed our own ways to kill each other off now, haven't we?"

"Indeed," Dan agreed grimly.

"Oh, look again, spoilsport," Tommy told him.

      Dan looked, and saw the same box now outfitted with gaudy colored LEDs that were flashing wild sequences and geometric patterns, making it hard for him to concentrate. He opened it and peered inside. There was a single word written on a sheet of unlined paper: "Hope".

      "It was the only thing that stays in the box when it's," Tommy told him. "Think of it as a sort of antidote to the use of the weapon itself. Even Pandora was surprised when-"

"Wait, what? Pandora?"

"The one and only. I don't like to name drop, you know. Sorry."

      "You expect me to believe..." Dan started to say, and then caught himself. "Okay, sure. Unicorns. My girlfriend is the Earth-"

"And a tree," Tommy reminded him.

      "So of course you know mythological entities. It's just, you know, hard for me to unlearn so much so fast. I'm trying. It's just..." He rubbed his temples with his fists. "I don't know. Part of me still wants the old world back."

      "Simple growing pains, my boy. We all go through that. Believe you me, the end result is well worth it. Just remember to breathe."

      He smiled at Dan, who suddenly realized that he couldn't remember the last time he had taken a breath. He nearly gasped, startled at the revelation, and resumed autonomic functions.

      "Neat, eh?" Tommy asked. "Saves a lot of wear and tear on the body. One of my little secrets. But remember this. You do have the old world. It's just that you have the new one now, as well. And the new one needs our help."

      "How?" Dan had been so caught up in the moment, he ignored the fact that he was talking to a younger version of himself. He reached out and touched the boy's shoulder.

Tommy smiled. "Oh, I'm real. Almost as real as it gets." "Almost?"
"Well, even God has a creator, right?"
"I don't know," Dan said. "What if he impregnated his own mother?" "Sshhh," Tommy said. "Ixnay oxnay the crazy alktay." He looked genuinely
nervous. "I'm just saying there is this, solidity, the physical world. And then there is the non-physical realm. Also real. Also here and now. And then there's the void. All equally real, and sometimes at odds with each other. There's a lot more I wish I could tell you..."

He trailed off, looking at the horizon distractedly. "Yes?" Dan asked impatiently.
"Not now. The game's afoot!"

      He gave a little laugh and ran up the beach. Dan was no match for his ten- year old self. When he caught up to him, Tommy was flying a kite shaped and

decorated like a colorful fish.

      "This is fun!" Tommy exclaimed. "I don't know why I didn't do this before."

"Fly a kite?"

"No, be ten a second time. It's even better than I remember it."

      "I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. But don't we have critical, world- affecting business to attend to?" Dan asked.

Tommy's childlike properties evaporated in an instant.

      "Oh, that," he said, sounding many years older than he had moments before. "Sure. The world."

      He heaved a sigh and let go of the kite string. They both watched it sail upward and away from them until it was a tiny point against the timeless sky.

      Tom cleared his throat. "I'm afraid Regina is, um, going overboard. I gave her full access, and even though she doesn't know the full extent of her abilities, she's tampering with forces better left alone."

"Such as?"

      "Well, she's tabulating the positives and negatives of everyone on the planet. The only reason she isn't done yet is because there are seven billion souls, and each has a full back-story. Still, to her credit, she's doing it, and fast. I suspect we don't have much time left. Days, maybe."

"Why's she doing that, and what does it matter?"

      "Oh, Dan. You're both alike. Delightfully unimaginative. Simply put, she's got her God hat on. She wants to enact the rapture."

Dan looked confused. "Where is she taking the chosen ones?" "She's not. She's going to keep them here, and eliminate the rest." "Kill them?"

      "No, not as such. Just disappear them, I guess you'd say. Delete delete delete."

"Why?"

      "Well, because she can. And in theory, it's a good idea. In practice, it's probably not."

"Why?"

"I suggest you get a new letter of the alphabet. That one is all worn out." "Oh," Dan said, unintentionally making a joke.
      "The world is a complex ecosystem, I guess you could say. Good or bad, we need those people. They perform functions that they aren't aware of themselves. If they weren't necessary, they wouldn't exist, would they?"

      "I refuse to answer on the grounds that I no longer know what to think, anymore," Dan answered.

      "Danny boy, that is the beginning of all wisdom. 'All that I know is that I know nothing'."

      A period of silence passed between them, and it seemed as though the universe itself went quiet for a moment. Dan felt the beach winds blowing through his head.

"At the same time, we know everything." Tommy paused for effect. "Whatever that's worth."
"Oh, I think you understand that knowledge is power, to a large degree." "If Regina is so powerful, why doesn't she know we're here?"
      "Please, Dan. Concede that old age and treachery can at least match youthful exuberance when the chips are down. By being born of Regina, I inherited a large subset of her powers. I'm now so close to her genetically that she can't read me very well. Clever, if I do say so myself."

"And me?"

"Oh, you're of little consequence right now. Plus, I'm shielding you.
Besides," he said, "We're on the moon..."

      Dan looked in the sky and saw a massive blue-green planet rising above the line of palm trees.
"Now how did I miss that?" Dan asked, more to himself than to Tommy. "Danno, the things you've missed could fill a book. Never mind that. I often
come here to think. It's quieter, and the beaches are cleaner." "I'm actually impressed," Dan said.
      "Membership does have its privileges, my boy. But right now it's a rather exclusive club."



Chapter 18 - Vacation
      Albert Onestone and President Long sat in beach chairs sipping Mai Tais thoughtfully left behind by Renee. The ever-faithful Mounties had returned to their families in time for dinner, as was generally the Canadian practice.

      "You know, Al," the President said, "You make an ugly woman. Otherwise, this is a nice little getaway. No responsibilities..."

      Al signed, and then grunted. "I can't believe you were the leader of the free world," he said.

"Still am, old man. Deal with it," the President replied. "You're drunk," Al said.
      "On the blood of the saints," the President said, and looked startled. "Where did that come from?" he asked Al.

"The center does not hold," Al said nonchalantly.

      The President's cell phone, battery dead, began to ring. He shot Al an annoyed glance, then shrugged and answered it.

      "Hi, this is Regina Long. I can't come to the phone right now, but if I could, I'd say 'I love you, daddy. I'll be home soon.' Beeeeeeep."

President Long calmly folded up his phone and threw it into the ocean. "What did she say?" Al asked.
"She's gone starkers, I'd say."

"That's nice. Sounds like the road to recovery." "Let's hope," the President said.
"Hope in one hand, and wish in the other," Al said, and they both giggled.

� � �

      A cell phone leapt out of the water like a flying fish and landed in Dan's hand. He looked at Tommy questioningly.

      "Go ahead and use it. In times like these, it's best not to look a gift phone in the mouth. Call someone."

"Who?"

"Try your mother." "My mother's..." "Try."
      Reluctantly, he dialed his mother's phone number, which was indelibly etched in his memory.

"Hello?" she answered. It was unmistakably her voice. "Mom? Hey, how are you?" he asked, feeling foolish.
      "Oh, Danny! It's so nice, here. The cruise was perfect, and everyone at the resort is so pleasant."

      "I'm really glad you're enjoying yourself, ma," he said. He really wasn't sure how to proceed.

"Guess what?" his mother said, taking the reins of the conversation. "Um," Dan replied.
      "I met a man...he's so nice, Danny. You'd like him. He looks just like your father did."

      Dan never knew his father, but he did have a few pictures to provide a frame of reference. His heart warmed at the thought of his mother and father together again, free and happy at last.

"As long as he makes you happy, ma. That's all that matters."

      "Oh, he does, Danny. So happy. He says we're going to run away to Mexico and get married."

      He could hear her smile through the phone, and he couldn't help but do the same, even though part of him knew the entire scenario was somewhat morbid and wrong.

"Well, you two kids have fun, okay?"

"We will, Danny. I'll call you when I get back. I love you, son." "I love you, ma," Dan said. But the line had already gone dead. "She knows," Tommy said.
      Dan folded up the phone and skipped it across the water. It bounced an impressive six times and then sank beneath the waves.

� � �

      Regina had been immobile since the day before the Oak Island expedition began. Her eyes remained open and unblinking, but she had become in essence a living statue. Tommy played in front of her with a bewildering array of toys culled from throughout the ages, occasionally sleeping or leaving the room to use the bathroom. A faint smile remained on her face.

      She was ready. Her tabulations were up to date. With a single directed thought, she was going to disappear one quarter of the world's population. That, combined with her covert, reversible sterilization program, would make life on Earth much more tolerable for the remainder.

      But she couldn't do it. For whatever reason, Regina could not yet allow herself to make that move. There was a growing seed of self-doubt within her. She suspected it was because she had failed to consult either Dan or her two fathers. At the last possible moment, she realized that, despite her newfound abilities, her impulses should be tempered by a male influence, inferior creatures or not.

      She summoned Dan, but he didn't appear. Likewise, neither did Al or President Long. The long, dark teatime of the soul, Regina thought despairingly. She

shut her eyes and withdrew into the void. Sensing this, Tommy's doppelganger promptly vanished.

� � �

      The world breathed a collective sigh of relief as Regina released her stranglehold on them. Their elation lasted mere seconds, and then turned into a rising panic. Her control was such that now, by relaxing her grip even slightly, the planet was in a tailspin. People and things began to grow and shrink, no longer tied to any particular scale or standard. In some cases, the aged were growing younger, and the youth were decidedly not aging. Hair spontaneously grew and shrank, changing colors all the while.

      The dead were coming back to life. Institutions and practices Regina had abolished were regenerating into bizarre new configurations, oftentimes in complete inversions of their previous incarnations. Banks became casinos, with ATMs paying out big winnings based on no discernable patterns. Actual money, a device Regina was deprecating on the way toward total elimination, sometimes fell from the sky in great flurries. Account balances grew and decreased without relation to one another. The churches were now pleasure zones.

      Even items of personal choice such as clothing began to randomize. The elderly started walking around wearing completely inappropriate attire: mesh muscle shirts, miniskirts, death metal and punk rock t-shirts. Children now wore anachronistic clothing: Victorian dress, Amish and Mennonite fashion, even loincloths. Every tenth person or so simply walked around naked, and every so often, all clothing vanished and was replaced by completely different outfits. It was simultaneously amusing and horrifying.

      Tattoos spontaneously appeared on people and were never even acknowledged. Each was exactly what the wearer desired, often reflecting their complex inner lives. With others, their old tattoos faded or disappeared, or were embellished with new colors and complexities.

      The machines and telecommunication systems were working again, but they would never be the same. They played pranks, imitating voices during phone calls, trying to sow dissent and create confusion. People quickly learned not to believe everything they saw and heard. Television and the Internet played different sorts of games with them. The notion of psychic TV was now a reality. Everyone saw a different show and received different messages. Thankfully, most weren't attuned to

higher thought, and so the bulk of these attempts at communication went unreceived.

      The Internet continually tried to lead people astray whenever they ventured beyond the handful of websites visited by most surfers. It specialized in offering frustration, working together with local terminals to provide a grain of annoyance, making many attempts at casual frivolity unenjoyable. Consequently, people began to interact with each other and the world with a newborn attitude. Actual communities began to form. For the first time in a long while, they began to speak to each other in public, as strangers, and it no longer seemed like strange behavior.

      The one thing the Internet still did well was pornography. But even this aspect of life had new twists. Each foray took the user into territory too mundane to be enjoyable, or found darker, stranger imagery. It wasn't for the faint of heart, and seemed to work best for couples. Amazingly, children, an arbitrary designation, now, were shielded from overt sexual images, much to their consternation.

      People still had the ability to lie and steal, but the results were often instantaneous, or preceded the events in question, so such occurrences became few and far between. Physical violence and murder were still possible, but people feared Regina more than the police. Consequently, such actions were rightfully classified as mental illness. Their guns and weapons had returned, however.

      Most disconcerting to everyone was the now varying effects of gravity. Everything seemed to have changing weight values. At times, people were able to perform great feats of strength, while at others, they were barely able to lift their eyelids, much less able to get out of their beds, couches or recliners.

      All of these things occurred in a mere second of Regina's timeframe, which translated into weeks for everyone else. The citizens of planet Earth began to long for her benevolent, tyrannical rule once again. But she was effectively dead to the world.



Chapter 19 - Moonstruck
      "Vacation's over," Tommy said to his older incarnation. "Time to be getting back home."

They were on the same beach, but the Earth had been replaced by the moon.
The transition was so seamless it took Dan a while to even notice. "Come on," Tommy said. "It's time to meet your maker." Dan looked at him with a combination of fear and disbelief. "Sorry. Bad joke. Time to go see mommy..."
� � �

      Like Dan and Tom, Al and President Long were in Regina's timeframe. The difference being that the sun, moon and stars had to move with the majority, so they perpetually rolled across the sky as day turned to night and back again every few minutes. Psychic war vets both, they took it in stride and quickly adjusted to the changes.

      "This reminds me of that stuff we used to eat all the time. What was it called?" the President asked Al.

"Pussy?" Al replied.

The President scowled at him slightly. "No, the other thing. Paper." "Heh," Al said. "Yeah, I remember paper."
A song erupted spontaneously from nowhere: "It's only a paper moon..." They clinked their glasses together in silent remembrance and celebration. "With times like these, who needs acid?" Al asked.
"Or pussy?" the President added.

"Speak for yourself," Al said. "The day they do away with that, I'm opting
out."

      "I was just kidding, guy. Sheesh. Sometimes I wonder what my wife saw in you," the President said with a wink.

      "My huge Wang," Al said without missing a beat, and the President choked on his drink.

      "No, seriously. She was really into vintage computers," Al said, and the President squirted Mai Tai out of his nose as they both convulsed with laughter.

� � �

      It was a long walk back to the compound where Regina lay dormant. It was dark, and eerily quiet. Tommy paid it no mind, but Dan had the urge to whistle as they went.

      "There's no graveyard here," he said, picking up the essence of Dan's thoughts. "You are still free to whistle, of course."

      As they walked, he grew and aged. When they had arrived, he was again an ageless old man. At the door to the building in which she currently resided, they paused.

      "The buck stops here," Tom said. "If she sees me like this, it'll dredge up the wrong sort of memories. I'm strong, but she's still stronger. I'm merely a demigod, at this stage."

      He smiled effusively and shrugged his shoulders. "Don't worry. I'll be here when you need me. But you two have a few things to discuss, do you not?"

      He nodded gravely, and stepped inside with no further instruction. He entered Regina's laboratory qua nursery and was confronted with Tommy's bewildering array of toys. They ran the gamut from a Mexican ball and cup to exotic vintage collectibles, many from Dan's youth. Right away, he saw the Micronauts and Shogun Warriors and felt a stab of nostalgia. There were large plastic replicas of Godzilla and King Kong, and an Alien doll by H.R. Geiger, replete with glowing skull and two sets of mandibles.

      It simultaneously delighted and frightened Dan. Because he got a glimpse of how Tommy played with them.

      He saw the young boy, himself as a youth, playing on the floor of his grandparent's living room. Many of the toys moved of their own accord, and his family pretended not to notice. But he wasn't playing. He was fighting some great and future war. Dan correctly perceived that the fate of the entire universe had been decided then. The rest was mere prologue.

      He paused a moment longer upon reflection and made sure they weren't moving now. It was then that he saw Regina. She was sitting rigidly in a high- backed Davenport chair with regal blue upholstery covered with fleur-de-lis. Her skin was a translucent green, as though she were made of jade or carnival glass. Her eyes were closed, and Dan could have believed she was a sculpture. She was certainly beautiful enough, serene and composed. A faint smile still played across her lips. But inside of her, a sacred heart glowed red.

Dan's own heart tried to leap out of his throat when she opened her eyes.
They were solid black, yet they glowed with an unearthly light.

      "Regina," he said, his voice barely a whisper. But she didn't move or respond. He couldn't even hear her telepathically, and that was perhaps most distressing of all.

� � �

      Al and the President both sat bolt upright, suddenly not at all drunk, and not at all having fun.

"Something's happening," Al said.

"It's a good thing we're here then, I guess."

"I hope the world ends," Al said quietly. "But not before I see my daughter." "Our daughter," the President reminded him.
� � �

"Regina," Dan whispered. "We need to talk."

      He couldn't think of anything else to say. She remained immobile, eyes open, but he thought he saw her heart beat. It happened so fast, he couldn't be sure. Much as he couldn't be sure of anything else.

"Please, Regina. The world needs you. This has gone too far. Come back to
us."

      He again got no response. For no apparent reason, he got down and kissed the tops of her feet. She didn't feel like glass, however, but more like gelatin, with the faintest whiff of...kiwi? No. Strawberries.

      At once, Dan was transported to another point in his past. He was eleven, living with his mother and siblings in a rundown section of town where the rents were cheap. He and some friends had built a treehouse. On a whim, he had taken a booklet of colorful food stamps, seventy-six dollars worth, from his mother's purse.

      It didn't feel like stealing, at the time. More like Monopoly money. But that day, he was king of the treehouse, and they ate candy and junk food to their hearts' content. Viewing it from this perspective, he realized that they couldn't have possibly spent more than twenty dollars, and never used them again.

So what happened to the remainder?

      Seventy-six dollars, stolen from his hard-working mother, brother and sisters. The weight of his guilt was crushing, unbearable. She had casually asked him about it, not really suspecting him, instead thinking that she had somehow lost or misplaced them, and he had lied about it. This simple childhood folly was tearing Dan apart. And it all came to mind because of the smell and texture of Regina's skin. He bought dry Kool-Aid and Jello as his snacks that day.

      Later, he and one of his erstwhile buddies had sat on a cinderblock wall smoking cigarettes for the first time. They didn't know about such things as nicotine poisoning, and had both smoked until Dan vomited, strawberry Kool-Aid coming out of his mouth and nose. At least it had put him off of smoking for a long time, he thought. In a moment of clarity or insanity, Dan saw himself taking the bundle of food stamps from his mother's purse, hesitate...and then put them back.

      In a flash, he was again in front of Regina. The cloying smell of kiwi- strawberry was gone, and her skin had returned to normal. Her unbeating heart still shone through, however, and her eyes were again closed.

� � �

      Al and the President, now resigned to ride it out on their beach chairs, felt a massive rumble pass through the earth. Even the sky quaked, and the sea began to churn and boil. Great waves passed left and right, perpendicular to the sand instead of toward it.

"It's goin' down, hops," the President said.

"Who writes this crap?" Al asked him in all seriousness. "What?"
"Nothing," Al said.

"At any rate, it'll all be over soon."

"One way or another..."

� � �

      Dan was again standing in front of Regina, but this time with a four-pound sledgehammer in his hand. On one side, the head was stamped "Mjolnir". The other read "Lil' David". Everything appeared to be happening in slow motion. He looked at Regina, her eyes again closed, and was not at all amused to see a miniature Tom appear on her right shoulder, in a little devil suit, no less.

      "Kill her, Dan," devil Tom said. "She's not doing it right. You can do better, you know that. Nothing will happen to you. She killed me, and nothing happened to her, did it?"

"I wouldn't call what happened to her nothing..." "But she wasn't arrested or anything, right?"
      "In a land populated with dinosaurs and unicorns, who would arrest her, the sheriff of Nottingham?"

"Touche, salesman. I too have an uncle." "What?"

      "It's endgame, Dan. Don't try to make too much sense out of things. The pop culture references might come fast and furious, at this point. Oops, I did it again, Britney. Oops, et cetera."

      More or less expectedly and on cue, angel Tom appeared on her other shoulder.

"Finally, the voice of reason," Dan said, visibly relieved. "Kill her," angel Tom said.
"What?"

"She's about to delete billions of people, Dan." "Delete?"
      "Kill. Disappear. Number them among the unloving. Killing her is the only way to stop it, now. Don't believe me? Wait and see."

"I can't. I won't. I love her."

      "Oh, Dan. Love is a silly human conceit. That's what keeps you on Earth, not gravity. You're addicted, Mr. Palmer."

Dan stood mute.

"Kill me, Dan," Regina's voice said in his head. Or was it hers? "Please.
Now. Hurry."

      Involuntarily, he raised the hammer, which looked like it could cause considerable damage.

      "I killed seven with one blow," Mickey the Giant Killer said. "They made me a star."

      Dan winced and closed his eyes, trying to block the voices competing for airtime in his head. When he opened them again, Regina had opened hers again as well. He saw her eyes dart to the upraised hammer and Dan knew he had committed a fatal mistake.

"Blue screen of death," she said. "Guru meditation error."

      Roughly two billion souls, most of them male, winked out of existence forever.

� � �

      Dan felt the loss, and then he was granted a new clarity. He was again on the moon with old Tom, standing on the same stretch of beach.

      "I'm actually impressed with you, Dan. No one that's been made the offer has been able to resist, before. You're entirely unique in that regard. How could you resist ultimate power?"

      "Because it's saddled with ultimate responsibility?" Dan said. "And I told you, I love her, no matter what you've turned her into. It's..." He struggled for the words.

"Radar love? Written in the stars?" Tom asked. "Superlove?"

      "Yes!" Dan exclaimed. "How did you kn-" he started to ask before catching himself.

"It's funny, Dan. While power may corrupt, absolute power is incorruptible." Dee-Lite's "Power of Love" issued forth from unseen speakers.
"So is true love," Dan said.

"Maybe they're the same thing," Tom said.

"No," Dan answered. "They're not. Pretty close, though."

      A bell sounded in his head, and he recognized it from "The Price is Right", a longtime favorite of his mother's. Dan suddenly wanted all of that lost time back, every wasted hour spent watching "Love Boat", "Fantasy Island", "Scooby-Doo" and the like.

      "But that was time spent with your mother and grandparents, Dan," Tom said, and Dan knew this was right.

      His stomach heaved as the planet began to shrink under his feet. Presently, he and Tom were standing face to face on a planet the size of a large beach ball. He wanted nothing so much as to leap off, disappear. It was way too much for him to take.

"You're the little prince of asteroid B-612, Danno," Tom said.

      His mind reeled as he recalled that odd little story from his youth. A young prince alone on an asteroid with a flower. Fairly bizarre subject matter for a story, he had thought at the time.

      "Regina's your flower, Dan. I suggest you start treating her as such." Tom handed him a potted iris, which was alien in its splendor. "Try not to mess this one up. You only get one, and I'm bending the rules as it is."

      The full weight of what he was telling him struck Dan like a brick. He could muster no word of thanks, but his gratitude shone brightly.

"Luckily, they're my rules to bend," Tom said. "More like guidelines,
really."

      Dan just stood dumbstruck, clutching his flowerpot as though it was the only thing keeping him from flying off into space forever. And in a very real sense, it was.

"Do you know how special Regina is, Dan?"

      Finally spurred into speaking, he said, "I always have. I feel like I've known her forever."

      "You have, Dan. You have. Come on, fun's over. Let's go home. I want my old job back."

"What did you do, anyway?" Dan had to ask.

      "Nothing. That's what makes it such a great job. Oh, sometimes I put Christ's face on a tortilla or something, but that's more of a hobby."

Dan started to shake, realizing who he was talking to.

"Relax," Tom said, waving his hand in his direction. He relaxed. "Hey, let's
jump."

      The moon scaled back to full size, and Dan felt smaller than an ant. A microbe, maybe. The beach scene disappeared, and they were on the stark surface of the moon, Earth's actual moon.

"Come on. Before you remember to breathe."

      He extended his hand again, and Dan grabbed it. They swung their arms as Tom counted them off.

"One...two...three..."

And with that, they leapt to Earth. Back to Eden.

                          � � � They walked in on a sleeping Regina.
      "You know, I almost kept her for myself. Her special qualities are matched only by your own. You can honestly say you were made for each other," Tom said.

"I don't know what to say," Dan said. "How can I possibly thank you?"

      "Just be happy. That's all I ask of anyone. And let her be happy, too. You can't make her be happy, just don't impede her, okay?"

      A single tear escaped Dan's eye in silent agreement. "Are you..." he started to ask him.

      "Yes, Luke. I am your father," Tom said with a wink. "Gotta go. Costume change. Be right back."

      Dan stood in silence as the room cleaned itself, and he noticed a few toys that he had overlooked the first time: a pink stormtrooper, Fisher-Price Little People versions of Lord of the Rings characters. They were handmade collectibles from a guy he sort of knew in New York. He made a note to contact him in the future. He had a feeling he'd be buying lots of toys, soon.

      Tom walked back into the room, this time as Dan at age seven, wearing a ridiculous Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit. He smiled at Dan and snapped his fingers.

Regina's eyes flew open.

      Tommy pointed his index finger at her and raised his thumb, making the handgun every boy forms at some point in their development. "Bang bang, mommy," he said cheerfully.

� � �

      Dan found himself leaning over a shivering Regina, who was coughing up seawater on the deck of the Mary Celeste II.

"Where am I?" she asked him.

"You're with me," he told her. "And you're safe."

� � �

"What about all the people she killed?" Dan asked. "My bad," Tom said.
"Your bad?"

      "So I use mother nature to do my dirty work. Come on. Did you really think I'd give up control for real?"

"Aren't you going to bring them back?"

"They'll be back soon enough. They breed like rabbits down there." "You're crazier than she is," Dan said.



The End
