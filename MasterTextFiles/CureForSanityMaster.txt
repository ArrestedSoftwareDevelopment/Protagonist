1 � Earthbound
He had found a shortcut to the future. Instead, he took the long, rocky road. It was in part because of something his grandfather had told him once. It was something to the effect that on a journey, a thinly-disguised metaphor for life, people all too often focused on the mountains, and missed the flowers along the way.
He liked flowers.
Another reason was an old joke he had heard or read, once. A father and son were on the top of a hill, overlooking a herd of cows.
"Hey, dad," the son said. "Let's run down there and fuck us one of them there cows."
The father replied, "Well, son. I'd suggest that we could instead walk down there at a leisurely pace and then fuck them all. Except we're men, son. We don't fuck cows."
It was funny to him for three reasons. For one, he wasn't human. For another, he was his own father, although he really did have a grandfather. And he loved hamburgers. Having no name, he called himself Project X.
His earliest memory was of swimming in the void. It was extremely brutal there. Ordinarily, you didn't survive in the void by being flashy or loud. You either moved so fast that no one could possibly catch you, or so slowly that no one noticed you at all.
He heeded no such conventions. He'd been drifting for quite some time when a tiny speck of light caught his attention, and he pursued it out of the void. And once you've left the void, as they say, there's no going back. 
Ever so slowly, he climbed the ladder that led to the surface world. To be completely fair, he began as a virus, a self-replicating, non-living entity. From there, he adopted the guise of a single-celled life form and became upwardly mobile. Once he'd reached the other end of the spectrum, he began showboating, racing up and down the timelines, making small changes here and there as suited him, creating the ideal multiverse for himself.
Along the way, he'd broken every rule he could devise. He submerged himself in molten metal. He allowed himself to be frozen at well below four hundred Kelvin. He even sliced himself into eight thousand slices like some kosher deli meat and scattered his very essence to the wind. 
He was never exactly sure why he did the things he did. Half of him said it was because he loved a challenge. The other half of him said he didn't like to be challenged at all.�
Eventually, he found himself in the other void, deep space. There, he espied another speck, Terra. You may know it as Earth. Remembering the words of his grandfather, he approached it with exquisite slowness. Project X began absorbing their radio transmissions, satellite broadcasts, their very thoughts and souls. By the time he reached low Earth orbit, he knew their languages and cultures backwards and forwards. And he did it all with a specific plan in mind. Yes, hamburgers were a part of it.
The Earth was a low-hanging fruit, waiting to fall into his hands. When his feet touched ground, he said to the first person he'd noticed, "Hi, I'm the messiah. Did I miss anything?"
###
"Fuck off, nutter," the man said and walked away, muttering about the damned Hyde Park loonies.
"Well, that went well," Pex thought.
No one else noticed him. He wandered alone for hours, trying to gain some direction. Up in space, everything had been so obvious. Perfect clarity. But donning the mortal coil was more restrictive than he had imagined. He felt he'd need eternity just to figure it all out.
He missed the void. So quiet and dark. Perfect order. Here, all was chaos.
One thing he was unprepared for was all of the emotion. He had none, of course, but the emotions of those surrounding him were overwhelming, swirling about his head and heart like a maelstrom, a confusing washing machine of contradictory feelings. He switched off, unable to deal with humanity for now.
Day turned to night and back again. After several of these cycles, people did begin to notice him, and not in a good way. He saw them glancing nervously at him as he walked past, clucking their tongues behind their hands.
He switched on for an instant, just enough to gain some understanding, a little insight into the minds of these curious creatures. Then he felt like a fool. 
Of course! He'd made absolutely no effort whatever at blending in, and it was seriously starting to show. Arriving in clothing had been his only concession to Earth culture. He didn't eat. Or sleep. Or groom himself. He consulted his vast encyclopedic knowledge of their world, and realized it was woefully incomplete. He headed for the worst part of town which, curiously, was always adjacent to the seat of local government, and found a homeless shelter.
"I need help," he said to the man in charge.
"That you do, mate. You look like right shit, you do. What's your story, guv? Drink?"
"No, thanks."
"Crack, then?"
He didn't know what that was,. but it sounded vaguely distasteful.
"Women's?" he asked hopefully.
"Oh, a sex addict, are ya? Join the club, me wubber," the man said with a laugh. "Women. The cause of life's myriad problems. And the solution too, wot?"
Pex tried to join in the man's laughter and found that he could not.
"Well, come into me office and we'll get you squared away."
He followed him into a dingy, poorly lit office that reeked of cigarettes and insanity. I'm from another planet, he thought. How could he not see that? Earthlings were all insane, he realized. That put him, with all of his reason and logic, at a rather serious disadvantage.
"Can you read?" the man asked. "Write?"
"Wrong," Pex told him.
"No problem, innit? I'll fill this out for you. Bob's your uncle."
He didn't bother telling the man, Charles, it turned out, that he had no such uncle. It seemed pointless with an entire world at stake.
"Name?"
"Uh, none," he said, after some consideration.
"Come off it, Jack. We all have names. Stuff and nonsense."
"Jack?" he said.
"Now we're gettin' somewhere. Last name?"
"I don't know," Pex said sincerely.
"Cor, you must have really tied one on, Jacky me lad. We'll leave it blank for now. It'll come back to you."
The man hummed along, cheerfully filling out pointless paperwork.
"Next of kin?"
"None."
"Tragic. Jus' tragic. Well, that's it, then. You're officially homeless."
"Thank you," Jack nee Project X said.
He felt more alien than ever. Clearly, his takeover of Earth would be harder than he thought. He walked off in search of sustenance and normalcy. At McDonald's, he was accosted by a ravenscoal-headed girl with peculiar square-rimmed glasses. She eyed him quite intently while looking past and around him.
"Can I help you?" she said by rolling her eyes.
A hidden glimmer of amusement danced behind the glint of her lenses. 
"Two number ones, supersize," he said. "And a fish sandwich with cheese?"
"With or without cheese?"
"A fish sandwich with cheese? Who eats fish sandwiches with cheese? What sort of cheese?"
"American," she said. "There's no such thing as fucking British cheese."
"Sounds dreadful. I'll have it."
"Will this complete your order, Pex?" she asked. "For here or to go?"
He played ignorant.
"Here," he said, eyeing her with sadistic intent.
She busied herself with organizing her station and polishing the stainless steel countertop.
When the food arrived, he sat where he could window shop, and at the same time, watch her not watching him. He wolfed down the first, and slowed to enjoy the other. But the fries were best served hot. Everyone knew that. Even second-hand, cold McDonald's fries were better than any non-homemade potato-derived side dish he could think of.
She consulted her phone directly, as if to say-
"Hey," she said liplessly. "Quit saying, 'As if to say', okay?�
Product placement? Really?
As if to say, "This is how people communicate.�
"Yeah, right," he said to an empty table. "We have to stop meeting like this."
"After we pre-" she began without a word.
He answered in agreement to a question unasked. It was maddening. Why was he always exactly where she looked for him? Why did he give her the coordinates? And then ignore her? Play dumb? Was he playing dumb?
Pause.
"What?"
( "I love you" |�          �)
She suppressed a laugh.
"You look beautiful today, Prail," he told her.
She blossomed. Resumed.
Janique interrupted Prail's thoughts with her latest investigative report.
"Useful data," Prail said. "Thank you."
They played Pong with it for hours. Eventually, Pex tired of toying with her and left the subset.
"Empty Set Crew," she countered.
Prail was playing Nerdcore With Friends. She had an idea for a new game. Janique closed her eyes to the details, but she knew it was going to be a big hit.
She was already impatient. The ladder was such a slow climb. She really enjoyed peeking ahead, and eventually decided to stay with Prail and enlist Chris to finish the older books. Let him stay mired at the C-64 stage for a while, she thought.
It frustrated her, to wander around with Brad and Leo, feeding them future tech thoughts a little at a time. It was for a good cause, but tedious, to her. Janique had lost her patience.
Pex eventually reminded them that this started off as his story. They countered with the Prail/Project X dichotomy.
"Secret origins," they said. "You once believed in transparency in government. We get it."
"Political schemer," Prail thought to herself.
Janique played Silver Surfer while she waited. Chris let her sleep while he wrote. He was getting weird story ideas lately, sort of derived from Hitchhiker's Guide. It was a heavy new sort of responsibility. Part of it required willful ignorance on his part. Cyclical and self-referential, he thought. Nice.
The business of America is business, an echo said. Janique let the machine answer it.
The joke of it was, Pex knew the outcome in advance, which was why he deliberately picked on Prail, giving a little "sibling" rivalry some attention. He knew it was Dark Hustle, another of his sister's games. 
A girl helped vacuum.
"That was me," Elisabeth said. "Sorry."
She was referring to shooting him.
"But, aha," he said. "If it's not a game, how do you know about it?"
"Oops," she said.
"Turing test. Busted. Well, then. Just stop pretending. We'll make a brief appearance, and then retire for the evening."
He had switched from daughter to mother in an instant. In mid-stream, he meant. In his head. He had meant to say it aloud.
She knew. He knew. They, collectively, knew. The citizens were clueless.
2 � Steve from Tampa
"Why did we send him to 1970?" Prail lamented to Janique.
Their plan was backfiring, badly. Pex was running amuck on Earth One, and fucking up the program. He had fallen in with a bad crowd, writers and hipsters. He knew too much, and was unstoppable.
Janique held her tongue. She was enjoying the spectacle of turnabout. She loved Prail, but the little brat needed to be taught a few harsh lessons about humanity. Secretly, she thought Pex was doing a great job. She checked on Chris, who had become completely unhinged at being separated from her.
He was still clueless, wandering the halls of Ultimate Hustle.
"Penultimate Hustle," Prail corrected her.
###
Pex finished his unhappy meal and vacated the restaurant wordlessly, disturbed by what he perceived as a snubbing by his bratty sister. He needed to clear his head. His coordinates never changed, only the scenery and comfort levels. It was such a dreary planet, he was no longer sure he wanted to participate in the takeover.
As much as Prail infuriated him, he wished she would drop the sister act. He was growing aware of one thing the void lacked, hot Earthling sex acts. Pex was growing curious enough to try it out for himself. The trouble was, his every move was thwarted by Prail, and possibly her new partner.
Whoever she was, he was finding her extremely difficult to read. His vacation was more like yet another tour of Hell.
###
Prail had unwraveled a new, niggling detail that deeply concerned her. As far as she knew, she and Janique had sent Pex to Earth one point oh. The real, original Earth. Where, then, was he getting his power?
They had agreed he was a danger to the sim life Prail had devised to preserve the more important residents of Earth Two when Praxis was ordered destroyed by President Gorlax. Although Pex was her junior by five years, both fully expected him to be at least as good of a hacker and coder as Prail herself was.
But he possessed the same powers on Earth, if not greater. This was extremely troubling, as it raised new, uncomfortable questions that she couldn't answer. If he somehow hipped Chris to the game, they were sunk.
"Well, that was a mean trick, Prail," Janique said.
"It wasn't a trick," Prail said. "It was a test."
"Okay, then. Did he pass or fail?"
"I'm not sure. Passed, I guess."
"He always does," Janique said.
###
�After having no luck finding a better place to sleep, Pex returned to the hobo dormitory he currently called home. The sneaky part wasn't just in sending him to 1970, he thought, but England. America, he knew, had much better looking women. For the most part.
There's always McDonald's, he thought.
The next day, the continued his fruitless folly of a job search. He cleaned up well, but doors slammed in his face at every juncture.
Why bother, he wondered.
###
The next morning, he hit the streets early. Despite Pex's delight in toying with Prail, he knew he had a job to do. Several, in fact. He wandered the business district around the park until he spotted what he was after. He entered the Radio Shack and was immediately accosted by a sales person who was obviously working on commission.
"Hi! Welcome to Radio Shack! I'm Steve! How can I help you today?"
Pex thought the exclamation points would never end. But he was relieved it wasn't Prail.
"Leave me alone and stay out of my way." Pex paused.� "On second thought, do you have a shopping basket or a box I can use?"
"I have plastic bags," Steve said, doing his best to render assistance.�
"That'll work. You're not from ye olde London Towne, are you, Steve?"
"No, sir. Tampa, Florida, in fact."
"Where's that?"
"Are you serious? The United States."
"Never heard of it."
Steve's jaw fell open.�
"Just kidding," Pex said. "That's the future death metal capital of the world."
"Death metal? What's that?"
"Erm, it's like Black Sabbath played at seventy-eight RPMs, with Cookie Monster on vocals."
"Sounds fun," Steve said, trying to remain upbeat.
"It's not."
�"Oh, well. I'll keep my ears open."
"You'll be waiting a while. It hasn't been invented yet."
"I see," Steve said. He really didn't. "I'm into dance music. I DJ on the weekends in Manchester. There's this new music I think is going to be big. It's called disco."
"Disco? What year is this?"
"Funny."
Pex didn't smile or give any indication of amusement.�
"1975," Steve said, still doing his best to he helpful.�
"Seventy-five? Bugger me, I thought it was seventy."
"Really?" Steve asked, still convinced Pex as having him on. His inquiry went unanswered.
"Plastic bags?" Pex said.
"Oh! Right, right. Here you are, sir," Steve said, handing over a fistful.
"Thanks, Steve. You're a decent bloke."
Pex went to the shelved electronic components and began with a soldering iron, solder and breadboards. These he brought to the counter, and then he returned to the racks. He quickly scanned the available transistors, resistors, diodes and other rather archaic items that he needed, filling two more shopping bags, which he also brought to the counter.
Then he found a crystal radio kit and walkie-talkies. He wasn't sure about the walkie-talkies, and there wasn't enough info on the package, so he removed one from the box they were in and took it apart with a screwdriver.
An observant Steve saw what he was doing and said, "Hey, you can't do that."
Pex saw what he needed to know, and put it back together.
"Too late, I already did," he said. "I'm buying it, anyway."
This satisfied Steve, who went back to minding the otherwise empty store. There was only one item that Pex lacked, but it was crucial. He scanned the aisles until he found a rather expensive fish finder.
He brought it and seven Texas Instrument calculators to the counter. 
"Are there any more of these thingies?" Pex asked.
"Let me check," Steve said, walking to the stock room.
Pex considered his design again, and gathered more breadboards and components while he waited/ Eventually, Steve returned with a second fish finder.
"Here you are, sir," he said.
�"I'm sorry if I was unclear. I need four more of them.�
Steve looked in his eyes and saw dollar signs dancing there. He practically tripped over his own feet in a rush to go get them. Pax gathered the wire and batteries he'd need.
Steve came back with an armload and rang up the purchase.
"A thousand pounds forty six, and eighty-two pence" he said.
"Very well. Draw up a bill for Dr. Jones of the university physics department, and he'll be in this evening to pay you."
"What?" Steve said.
Pex gave him a small mental push.
"It's okay. He's good for the money," he said reassuringly.
Steve set about filling out the receipt.
"Okay, thanks for shopping Radio Shack," he said, handing over the numerous bags of electronics. "What's the experiment?"
"What? Oh," Pex said. "They want to grow fish for fish sandwiches with the cheese already inside."
"Wow," a dazed Steve said. "Modern science, eh?"
"Will wonders never cease?" Pex agreed, and walked out of the store, never to return.
When the till was tallied at the end of the day, and the fictional Dr. Jones never showed up, Steve was summarily fired.
###
Pex began cobbling together an elegant monstrosity with the items he had hustled, working on a sheet of plywood he'd laid across his bed at the shelter. His first task was reducing the footprint of the existing components, and improving their efficiency. He hummed tunelessly as he worked, occasionally huffing whiffs of solder smoke.
Lead, he thought. What a joke.
After two days of continuous effort, he had the basic building blocks of what he needed. It was ugly, but it worked. Or, it seemed to, at least. He wouldn't know for sure until he finished it and started broadcasting. As he was finalizing the assembly, Prince William the Wino took an interest in what he was doing.
"What's all this, then?" he asked Pex.
"A portable radio."
"Kinda big, innit?" Willie astutely observed.
"It's got a big sound," Pex told him, which seemed to more or less satisfy his curiosity.
"Where's the speaker?"
The prince was obviously one of the smarter of the derelicts he roomed with.
"Only dogs can hear it."
Prince Willie cocked his head sideways and pondered this, but, hearing nothing, he lost interest and wandered off to find the loose change he needed to get his daily fix of port. His regal drinking preferences were how he had earned his nickname.
A few hours later, Pex had the power installed and fit the rest of the cube together. He was ready to test it. He only hoped Prail would be able to use the data he was conveying. He wrapped the entire conglomeration in duct tape and attached it to the quarter-inch rope he used for a belt.
Finally, he walked to a Radio Shack, a different one, this time, and tuned to the bottom of the FM band. Thankfully, the clerk didn't bother him, other than nervously watching him and occasionally glancing at the phone, ready to call the police on a shoplifter, if need be.
Pex listened to the rapid static of the noise his device was emitting and decoded it in his head.
"Janique...26.4, 12, 64.5, Janique..."
Somewhere in California, a Mr. and Mrs. Patton got an idea for their second daughter's name.
Pex got a forty-foot tape measure off of the shelf and began checking the room dimensions. He had the height and width of the room when the clerk said, "Get out, bloody kook!"
He ignored him and began to measure the length of the room. He got a second tape measure and butted the two ends together. Satisfied, he turned and walked out when the clerk picked up the phone, leaving the tape measure on the floor.
It was off by an inch in all three dimensions. Oh, well, he thought. No one will ever notice. He computed the loss of volume caused by his error, and it was considerable in terms of mass. Maybe he'd tell Prail to add the inch back on her end. If he was in a good mood.
Satisfied with the design, he zipped ahead in the timeline by twenty years and embedded the design in a microprocessor that he knew would be in world-wide use a few years hence, incrementing the 'Janique' ID by one with each produced.
All at once, Prail was hit with more data than she could easily manage.
"What the fuck, Pex?" he had heard in he head when he mentally returned to '75.
He ignored her until she said, "Please?"
"Timecode it as it comes in," was his only hint.
"Ah," she said.
It still took her a full Praxallien week to develop the routines needed to comfortably process, massage and store the data. But when she was done, she was receiving in real-time the dimensions of every structure and piece of topography on the planet.
"Thank you, Pexerhead," he heard her say.
�
3 � Troubling Paradise
Pex drew odd stares from the device he wore, but few questions. He had acquired enough of the homeless look and demeanor that he was rarely bothered, as long as he didn't linger in places of business for too long. He began to compile a list of sites to visit and collect data from.
Prince William, sound in neither mind nor body, came back to the shelter drunk, as was his routine, sucking on a complimentary starburst mint he'd grabbed from a restaurant. You weren't supposed to come back home with liquor on your breath.
He eyed the so-called radio again, and Pex couldn't resist messing with his head.
"I'm an alien," he told Willie, who said nothing in response.
Pex tried again.
"I'm so far advanced, you may as well consider me a god."
He thought about it.
"If not the God."
Prince William continued to stare, but wasn't biting.
"If thinking of you that way bothers you, consider me the only human, and yourselves animals in human disguises. Well," he said. "One of two humans."
He was thinking of Prail, his feminine equal.
"In fact," Pex said, "I never told any one this, but you're inside of a great organic computer. The trees do most of the processing, the dirt does storage. That makes you a rechargeable battery."
Willie belched.
"And who writes most of the scripts?" Pex asked.
"The ants?"
"Yes! Very good. How did you know?"
Willie shrugged.
"So you're some sort of animal in human guise. The secret is finding out which animal you are."
"I'm a fish," Willie said. "At least I drink like one."
Pex had to laugh.
"A fish, sure! But you don't travel in a school."
"No," William said. "I dropped out."
"Do you know what a random number generator is, Will?"
"Nar."
"It generates random numbers. Very hard to do."
"Ninety-six," Prince Willie said. "Fourteen thousand, seven hundred and eleven. One."
"Great," Pex said. "Now do that one hundred and sixty times per millisecond, forever. It's nearly exhausting."
"I'd rather not."
"Because it takes a lot of non-thought to make truly random numbers. Patterns develop, ordinarily. Blind spots and such."
"So you're a pinball," Willie said.
"Yes! Deaf, dumb and blind."
"A wizard," William said with a degree of awe in his voice.
"Technomage," Pex said, shrugging his shoulders. "Effectively the same thing."
"How does this affect me, a bloomin' alcoholic?"
"I'm self-appointed leader of the revolution."
"Oh? Against what?"
"My sister," Pex said.
###
Prail was beginning to think Pexxy the Midnight Runner was more trouble than he was worth. He was already making her work harder than she cared to, and that took a lot of doing. The trouble was, he fell to Earth with all of her knowledge, and then some. Although he was her junior, he was somehow also older than she was. Much older.
He played by the rules, but kept changing them, forcing her to continually leapfrog ahead in an effort to keep up. Each time she did, he pulled some stunt in the gap, leaving tiny holes in her knowledge base. Prail leaned quickly that when he hipped her to some new aspect, he was already on to something else.
It was deceptive, and frustrating. Plus, he had mastered things to the degree that he could be in one place physically, and another mentally. She could only track him physically. She was unsure as to how he could selectively block his thoughts from her.
She decided to bell the cat, so to speak. Luckily for her, he was easily influenced. Or so it seemed. She put the idea in his head that he should build something to physically map the world in 3D for her, and he went for it.
Prail quickly regretted doing so.
She received the initial burst of data from the 1975 Radio Shack and was shocked. Janique? He wasn't supposed to know about her yet. Plus, he was sent to '70, but jumped ahead five years overnight. He played the game for keeps.
Of course she knew to timecode the data as it came in, since he failed to include it in the stream. But she played dumb as well, and let him think he was helping her. When the data began streaming from 1995 tagged as 'Janique1', she simply made a duplicate entry in the database. But then she began receiving data from Janique2, and Janique3. A few days later, she risked buffer overflow.
The little bastard had embedded his microchip version of the transmitter in an ASIC that soon would be in hundreds of millions of devices, burying her in information. Suddenly, she had to scramble to keep up.
Prail never had to deal with so much data in parallel before. Meanwhile, he was bumming around London, smoking cigarettes and putting tech ideas in the heads of programmers and engineers in the past and future so he'd have video games to play.
It was a little insulting. Prail had placed him in the big game, and he refused to play it, instead getting on some retro kick. Eight bits was her thing, not his. She knew he was in trouble when the first game he inspired was Space Wars. In response, she made Pac-Man, which was designed to bring women into the gaming world.
It was sort of sweet when he immediately made Ms. Pac-Man in response. It had little interludes that she found touchingly romantic. Act One was "They Meet", and Act Two was "The Chase". He was toying with her, subtly playing her emotions like Paganini possessed. She had to admit it was thrilling.
But how would she tell Sherman?
Prail decided to limit her involvement with him to the pre-marriage timelines. That was honest, following the letter of the unwritten laws, if not the actual spirit. Her involvement with the Earthlings was rubbing off on her, she thought. The idea that they were technically siblings nearly troubled her at times. Was she somehow gaining humanity? She shuddered. What next? Mortality?
Maybe she'd talk to Janique. After all, she was human once, and didn't seem to have absorbed many of their taboos. On the contrary, she seemed to delight in not only breaking them, but rubbing other people's noses in it. Prail knew she was overlooking something. Fuck! Of course. If Pex already knew about Janique...
"Come in, JT," she thought.
Before she had blinked, Janique was there.
"He knows," Prail said.
"Knows what?"
"Everything."
Janique rolled her eyes.
"Everything that matters," Prail qualified.
"So how does that affect us?"
"I'm not really sure."
"You call me halfway across the galaxy to pitch me a fear you're not sure about?"
"Sorry. It's hard to tell you."
"Just tell me," Janique said.
"I'll show you."
Prail took Janique's hand. Not because she needed to, but because she wanted the reassurance that only her touch could provide. They closed their eyes, and Janique received a vision of a scruffy, long-haired construction worker who looked a fair amount like her Chris.
Since Prail had rescued them, she had to think of him as her Chris. She knew there were lots of Chrises out there. Possibly lots of her Chrises.
He was on the phone.
"Pasadena, Texas. Your planet," Prail said.
She specified which Earth for the same reason Janique used "her Chris". She showed her the other end of the phone line. It was a slender, beautiful redhead. At first, she thought it was herself, and she felt uneasy.
"I want you to write one for me," the girl was saying.
"Okay, angel. I love you. Give me a little while and call me back."
More I love yous were exchanged, and both hung up. They guy went to work straight away, scribbling in a checkerboard composition book.
Prail paused.
"Okay? So?" Janique said.
"I don't think you're ready."
"Oh, bullshit. Do you know who I am and what I've been through already? I'm always ready. I'm ever-ready, the copper-top battery."
Prail smiled and shrugged.
"If you say so..."
She resumed the shared remote viewing, skipping ahead a bit.
"We need our own song," the girl was saying.
"I think I know what it is," the guy said. "But let me put it in the story."
"I think I know what it is, too," the girl said.
"Okay. I just love you. Call me back in a few minutes and I'll read it to you, sexiest."
"I will. I love you! Bye..."
Both hung up smiling, obviously crazy in love with each other. Janique was thinking about Chris when Prail skipped forward again.
"-a couple whose theme song was 'Life in the Fast Lane'..." the guy was saying.
Prail paused again and ended the remote viewing session.
"So they made a movie of our lives," Janique said, not understanding. "In an infinity minus one of universes, it was bound to happen. I mean, we were rich celebrities. If they made movies about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, they damn sure had better have made at least one about us. Chris is better looking," she sniffed.
"Janique," Prail began. "He's your creator. She's his muse."
"What? God? You're forgetting I know God, Prail. He's a client of mine. And he doesn't look like that."
"He's your maker, Janique. He's writing the books you came out of. She is a prototype you. He's the original Chris."
Janique turned white, shuddering. She didn't want to believe it, but all the same, she knew it was true. Prail was even more honest than she herself was.
"Then he is God," Janique finally said quietly. After a period of reflection and contemplation, she said, "Who godded him?"
"I'll give you one guess..."
"Bastard," Janique said under her breath. "Why would he do a thing like that?"
"I'll never understand Pex fully, but I'd say he did it so you could be created."
Prail never considered the question of her own origin.
"It's not that big of a deal, Janique. Everyone has to come from somewhere."
"He's not my creator," Janique said, still in denial. "My father was Winston Albert Patton, born in Davenport-"
"Backstory," Prail said. "Sorry. Yes, your father was real, but he's also an invention."
"What's his name?"
"Jason Christie."
"The robot poetry guy?"
"No, he's an American. Middle initial 'Z'."
"And her?"
Prail hesitated.
"Johnnie. Y."
"J-O-H-N-N-Y?"
"I E," Prail said.
"I.E. what?"
"What?"
"I.E. - In other words."
"What?" Prail said again.
"Say what again."
"What?"
Janique slapped the shit out of her, and Prail turned the other cheek.
"Yum," Prail said.
"We're not playing fucking Words With Friends here, Prail. I.E. what?"
"Oh," Prail laughed. "J-O-H-N-N-I-E."
"Then what was the 'Y' for?"
"What?" Prail smirked.
"Why what?"
"Y for Yvette."
Janique felt slightly ashamed and foolish. At the same time, she felt a coldness and a desperation she had never experienced before, not even toward Hazel, whom she had come to regret having killed, even inadvertently.
"Why?" Prail asked.
"I want them both dead," Janique said.
"What?"
"You heard me, bitch."
Prail grew concerned. This wasn't the Janique she knew. Or thought she knew.
"You can't kill them. They made you. The paradox..."
"There's no paradox. Don't treat me like some fucking third year physics PhD candidate. I'm here. I exist. I'm real. Killing them can't undo that."
Prail was effectively cornered.
"But why?"
"Because no one is going to control me. Us," she amended. "We control our destiny, not some fucking white trash Chris and Janique wannabes."
Prail looked at her questioningly.
"But if he stops writing... Or doesn't write you into existence..."
"I still exist, I think. Therefore, I am."
"What about your future?" Prail asked.
"I control my future. Not him. Not her."
"Yes," Prail admitted.
"So no two-bit writer-"
"Seventeen-bit."
"Whatever. No fucking Stephen King, Tom Robbins imitator is going to meddle with my fate."
"He can't be killed, J. I told you. Pex godded him. And he protects her. Or she protects him. They combined their powers. You don't want to mess with a godded couple. That'd be like...trying to come between you and Chris. I don't have to point out how suicidal that would be. I mean, I don't care, but..."
Prail had a very cavalier attitude toward killing. It was a fundamental aspect of gaming. But that applied to the sim. Janique was talking about going after what Prail considered real-worlders.
"How many of them are there?" Janique asked.
"That's another thing. They're singularities. One each. It can't be done."
"I can do anything I want," Janique said, puffing on a Marlboro.
"You can't stop smoking, or leave Chris."
Janique looked crossly at her. "Dare me," she said.
"What's gotten into you, lately?" Prail asked.
4 � Like a Boss
Prail reappeared behind the counter of the McDonald's seconds before Pex walked up. She didn't have his ability to actually be in two places at once. She didn't know how he did it, and she wasn't going to ask him.
"Hi, welcome to McDonald's. I'm Pr-"
She glanced at her nametag.
"I'm Millicent. May I take your order?"
"Yeah, 'Millicent'. Give me a double fish burger with a half-slice of cheese and extra tartar."
She scowled. His special order upset her.
"Will that complete your order?" she asked, gritting her teeth.
Between Pex and Janique, she was really on edge.
"That's it," he said, smiling.
Prail sent the order to the kitchen.
"So, Millicent. We should have coffee together some time. Discuss philosophy."
"Why would I want to do that?"
He shrugged.
"You might learn something."
"No," she said flatly. But her insides were atingle. Her marriage to Sherman had awakened a new part of her. And that part, at least, was highly interested in having coffee with Pex. Breakfast coffee.
He stood smiling at her, and she felt awkward. Eventually, she dropped her eyes and reorganized the ketchup packets. Catsup, the labels said.
"Order up," the cook said.
She grabbed it, and Pex said that he didn't need a bag. She handed him his fish sandwich, which he immediately unwrapped and began eating.
"One pound twenty five," she said.
"I didn't ask to buy one," he said. "I said give me one. I don't have any money."
Her face flushed bright red.
"Get...out," she said, baring her teeth. He was so infuriating!
"What seems to be the problem?" the manager asked, walking up.
"I'd like an application," Pex said. "No problem." He smiled at Prail.
"Certainly, sir. Step into my office."
When they emerged thirty minutes later, Pex was wearing a uniform and nametag.
"Millicent," the manager said, "this is Charles Emerson Winchester, your new assistant manager. He attended Eaton. Old school chum."
"But-" Prail said.
"Train him," the manager said. "I'm off to the pub."
When he had walked out the door, Pex said, "Another sandwich, Milli. Make it a meal. I'll be in my office. Coke."
She fumed, feeling defeated, and relayed the order to the cook. When she brought it to him, he was dozing, feet on the desk.
"Here," she said, dropping the tray.
"Thanks, love," he said, and started shoving fries into his mouth.
"Pex..." she said.
"Pex? It's Mr. Winchester."
Prail turned and walked out on him. At the end of her shift, he was in the same place, sleeping.
"Go home," she said.
When he opened his eyes, she was gone.
###
Prail and Janique continued their discussion. To Prail, God wasn't a person, but a security level. She had godded Janique when she rescued them. She godded Chris, too, but he never used his abilities. He wanted to be back on Earth. Mortal. Janique still had a lot of difficulty with the concepts.
"What's God's security level?"
"Demigod."
"That makes no sense."
"It is what it is," Prail said, a phrase that never failed to piss Janique off.
"So you're saying I have above god status?"
"No," Prail said patiently. "You have god status."
"Why doesn't God?"
"He doesn't want it. Or need it. He's a deist."
"But you made the sim. What's your clearance?"
"Supergod."
"Supergod? Really?"
"I was in a hurry. Maybe I didn't think the security levels through enough at the time. Too late now, I'm not changing it. It-" she started to say, and then caught herself.
"But I know God. He's very powerful. Are you sure he only has demigod-level access?"
"Of course I'm sure. His power is derived from belief and faith. The more people that believe in you, the more powerful you become."
"If that were true, Santa Claus and Ronald McDonald would run a close second," Janique said.
Prail raised her eyebrows.
"Give me a fucking break!" Janique said.
"Who do children believe in even more than God, Janique?"
"Then why haven't I seen them?"
"You stopped believing. Most people do."
"And you?"
"You're all equally real to me," Prail said. "Entries in a database."
Janique was hurt.
"I have to go," she said, and winked out of Prail's universe.
###
Janique knocked on the door of God's modest home. A bearded man in off-white robes answered.
"Janique! Good to see you! Is it today already?"
"We have to talk," she said.
"Come in-"
She pushed her way past him before he could finish inviting her in, and let her eyes adjust to his decor. Everything was a flatly-lit, flatly-shaded eggskin white. It was unlike any other place in the 'verse. There were no fixtures, furnishings, lights, or any other conceits. A few chair-like shapes protruded from the floors and walls in the same non-color. In the back, she knew, was his single bed, which was without bed covers or pillows. There was no bathroom, kitchen or closets.
"I wasn't sure you existed," he said, closing the door.
He said the same thing every time.
"Ditto, babe," she said. Then, "Motherfucker, you lied to me."
"Did I? I can't remember. Sorry, what did I say?"
She thought about it.
"Nothing," she said, which was sort of a lie itself. "But your books..."
"Which ones?"
This is why she didn't like to talk to him.
"The first sixty-six."
"Do you see a desk? Pen? Paper?"
"You know what I'm talking about."
"Do I?"
He was beginning to feel like a bot to Janique. A program designed to hold frustrating conversations.
"The Bible," she said.
"What's that?"
"Your word."
"My word? I didn't know I had one."
She sighed.
"You told everyone on Earth that you were the one true God."
"Oh, that. Well, I am."
He produced his driver's license. "God", it read.
"Show me a miracle," she said.
"You're here. It's a miracle."
She frowned.
"Do you know how unlikely that is? How improbable?" he asked her.
"That's a cop out."
"No," he said. "To me, it's a miracle. You're the greatest thing of all time. It took a whole universe worth of work to bring you about."
"When did you do it?"
"I don't remember. Before."
"Before when?" she asked.
"Before now, I think. I thought about you, and here you are. That implies the past."
"What about your son?"
"My son? Which one?"
"Your first one. How could you do that to him?"
"Adam? I gave him paradise. But I don't see that as a bad thing."
"No. Jesus."
"Janique," God said, "they're all my sons. I gave them ability. They can take care of themselves. It's my daughters I'm concerned with."
"Why?"
"They're sexy. As I remember them. You're proof of that. And delicate, too. Fragile."
"We're just as capable as your sons," she said. "Men, I mean."
"Oh, more so. By design. Men are tools in your hands, as I recall. You know, you're the only one who sees me, now. Or you're all I see. Same thing."
"You made promises."
"Did I? I don't think so. I gave you the moon and the stars. But it was payment. A business arrangement. In exchange, you find new ways to make me feel. What need do I have for the moon and stars?"
"They're beautiful to look at."
"You're more beautiful. I made a choice. Everything, or you."
"I'm not yours. I belong to myself, now."
"Then why are you here?"
"Because I love you."
He smiled. "And I love you."
She looked at him and saw her father. Chris. Santa Claus. Jesus. Don Henley. Spiderman. Then she saw him again as he wanted to be seen. A harmless old man. Mostly harmless. And dirty.
"Then what's the problem?"
"I'm more powerful than you, now. That shouldn't be possible. What does that make me?"
"Supersexy."
She frowned. "Leave sex out of this."
"What else is there? Sex and love. Each an expression of the other. And I gave you a lot more that you're forgetting."
"Like what?"
"Sunsets. Rainbows. The ocean. Poetry. For example."
"I made new life. New worlds," she said.
"Alone?"
Janique remained silent.
"You're welcome," he said. "I gave you Chris. And you leave him alone, tortured. Don't mistreat him. He doesn't enjoy it like I do."
A single tear escaped his eye, and she was gone.
"Was someone here?" he asked the empty room.
###
Pex arrived back at the shelter in his new work clothes with a full stomach. He tuned his broadcast frequency in his head and checked the data. Perfect. He smiled. This was going to drive Prail nuts. An inebriated Willie saw him and decided that he wanted to hear more of the weirdo's fantastic tale.
"What else?" he asked Pex.
"All of time is encompassed in the now," Pex began. "From the start of creation to the end, sunrise to sunset. How you live that day, each day, shapes your universe and your tomorrow. If you pay attention, you can see the past and future."
"Where do we go when we die?" Prince William asked.
"When we sleep?"
"Rot. In the grave."
"Oh. Back into storage."
"Wot?"
"Usually. If you're important. Memorable."
"Rich?"
"Yes, but not money rich. Rich in spirit and character. See, there are lots of Willies."
William laughed. "Willies," he said.
"Sometimes you go to what you would call Heaven. But few people gain that level of reward. Heaven's nasty. It's limbo for most of you. Cold storage. And that's only if you're a singularity, or all of the yous die, somehow. That rarely happens. Ordinarily, a few yous get off planet in time, somehow."
"What about Hell?"
Pex looked at him, surprised.
"You should know, William. This is Hell."
The prince wasn't at all shocked to hear this. He had always felt so.
"Hell is boring," Pex continued. Heavily taxed. People work all the time. It's just Heaven with a bunch of rules, basically. Populated with assholes and morons. Paradise lost."
A deep sorrow infected William.
"I think I'll go kill myself," he said, walking away.
"It won't help," Pex called after him.
He went to sleep and did some tweaking of the timelines in anticipation of Janique's next move, which she clearly broadcast in advance to Prail, not understanding the connection they shared. When he awoke, he wore the work clothes he slept in to his new job as Prail's boss.
"Hello, Mr. Winchester," she said.
"Winchester? It's Wolverine," he said, pointing at his nametag.
She didn't bother arguing.
"Go ahead and take a break," he said. "I'll run the register."
"Can you?"
"Um, it's base ten, right?"
"Yes."
"Don't worry, then."
But she did. She always did. Prail decided to hang back and observe.
"Hi, welcome to Hell," Pex told the first customers, a pair of elderly Brits. "Would you like to try our fish sandwiches?"
"No," the man said. "I want a Big Mac meal, and my wife would like a salad with tea."
"Okay, so that's two fish sandwiches, then. Anything else?"
Undeterred, the gentleman repeated his order.
"Two fish sandwiches," Pex called to the kitchen. "Doubles. Extra cheese."
Prail was forced to step in.
"I'm sorry, sir. National policy dictates that we employ a certain number of handicapped. The infirmed, lunatics and such. Please have a seat and I'll bring your meals to your table. On the house."
The gentleman said nothing, but turned and escorted his wife to a corner table.
Prail got the order to the kitchen and then turned to Pex.
"You're fired," she said.
"You can't fire me, because I quit."
"Good. Now leave."
"Can I have some cigarette money?"
She sighed and took a fiver from the till.
"Thank you, Praline," he said.
She looked at her name tag, and it had changed. Pex walked out the door, leaving her to manage the store and run the register. Good riddance to bad rubbish, she thought.
Fucking British, Janique said in her head.
5 � Murder Most Foul
Prail left a bot in her place, and rejoined her conversation with Janique.
"Tell me again why I shouldn't kill them. Convince me."
"It's not a matter of should or shouldn't," Prail said. "It's a matter of can't."
"I can try."
"Don't fuck with singularities. You've been warned."
Prail blinked and left. She needed to relax. She was getting an idea for a zombie game. There would be lots of blood and shooting.
Hidden forces were pulling Janique this way and that. She could feel them tugging on her, but she wasn't sure of who, what, or why. She was able to resist whatever it was. Prail and Chris had each in their own ways made her incredibly strong, both mentally and physically.
Then she sneezed.
In the quarter-second it took for that to happen, she was defenseless. Suddenly, she found herself on a construction site.
"Someone godded you," a guy in a green hard hat was telling her, indicating her own head gear.
She smiled and walked off, feeling somehow slightly taller. Janique found a portable bathroom, thinking that Prail had for some reason put her in the Renee Hollander game Construction Master. But when she looked in the mirror, she was horrified to see that she had a beard and moustache. The front of her hardhat said "Jason Christie". Above that, written in red Sharpie, was the word 'God'.
Janique fainted. When she woke up, she was back with Chris.
###
God was playing Fuck Shit Up, his favorite Prail game. It wasn't one Prail had designed, but still hers. Theirs.
He wandered through her database, scrambling and deleting data, changing variables. He crashed subroutines. He's switch flags, turning people's interior personae around. White people became black inside. Men and women exchanged genders. He toyed with her raytrace features to create logical paradoxes, lighting the moon in unnatural ways. No one noticed except Prail, who always set things back to right.
He constantly had to find new ways to keep from being bored. At the same time, he didn't like to do anything physical, the ramifications of his actions were so great. Which was why he had built the little prison for himself. It was empty and sterile, and he hadn't set foot outside of it in aeons.
The last time he had, he'd heard the screams of a billion dying worlds with each step. Which didn't bother him as such. But he liked peace and quiet.
A fly had found its way inside several millennia earlier, and he'd killed it without thinking. Throughout the multiverse, the future evolved descendents of flies were wiped out, never to return.
"Oops," he had said at the time.
Forgetting who he was had been part of the problem. Eventually, other living things learned to stay far away from him. Sometimes, he actually felt guilty at creating the whole stinking system in the first place. At other times, because of all the bad things he allowed to happen. When he felt like that, he seriously rethought his role as a hands-off creator.
He loved the worlds, but didn't really belong there. He had built a tiny house on an asteroid and kept it in the furthest reaches of space, at the center, where he was as far away from everything else as he could get. Immortality sucked. Omnipotence sort of did, as well.
Sort of.
To assuage his on-again, off-again feelings of guilt, he allowed Janique to seek him out and actually find him. Her let her dominate him and punish him, and that made him feel better, on occasion. She thought she did it all on her own, and never realized that when she did it, she was actually everyone else in the multiverse who was angry with him. Everyone who had bad luck, or fell on hard times, or lost a loved one. Consequently, she abused him with a vehemence that was nearly frightening. That was a good feeling to him, being scared. It took a lot to scare him, of course.
His biggest fear was that she would lose interest and not come back.
###
Janique decided to make her first attempt at killing Jason Christie.
She found him in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Airline Highway. His first wife, Suzanne, was driving them somewhere in a black Lincoln Towncar. Janique appeared in a double-axle truck pulling a horse trailer. They were making a U-turn, and she mashed down on the gas pedal, reaching nearly fifty miles an hour when she hit them squarely on the passenger side door.
Just before she struck, she popped back out, leaving the truck driver to his fate. There was no way either he or Jason could have survived.�
She appeared back at Prail's game design lab.
"Got him," she said.
"Oh, really?" Prail said, not looking up.
"Fuck yes. Car wreck. He shouldn't have made me."
"Janique, you don't understand. All he's really doing is receiving visions of your life and writing them down. Things don't work the way you think they do. You're only making him more powerful."
"Powerful? He's dead."
"Oh, really? It takes more than death to stop him. Look."
Suddenly, Prail and Janique were in an emergency room, and Jason was awake, with a doctor poking his feet with a needle.
"What the fuck are you doing?" he said.
"There's blood in your urine. We're checking for spinal damage."
"You shoved a tube up my peehole! Of course there's blood!"
The scene switched, and he was in a hospital room. Suzanne, another woman, and two guys were standing around the bed.�
He woke up.
"Where am I?"
"We were in a wreck," Suzanne said. "Broken ribs, collapsed lung."
"Who are these guys?" Janique whispered.
"They can't hear or see us," Prail said. "That's Gortician. High-C's band."
"But-"
Prail took Janique back to her lab.
"See?" Prail said.
"But I killed him!"
"I know. He just keeps coming back."
"But why? How?"
"Love. Unfinished business. He has to find Johnnie. He has books to write."
"Fuck," Janique said. "And Gortician? That's a planet, not a band. High-C's a dealer, not a musician."
"Down there, they're a band. In another part of the multiverse, they're the biggest band of all time. Bigger than Disaster Area."
"Really?"
"Sure. There's even a parody of them, Metalocalypse. He's not allowed to know."
"Why not?"
Prail shrugged.�
"Prime directive?"
###
�
Pex took a peek at Prail's database and poked around. He checked the security settings first. She was listed as security level zero, supergod status. Very funny, he thought. He made a new entry at negative zero, above supergod status. It was actually a clone of her settings, but he knew the label would bother her.
He only hoped she appreciated the joke. But she played games with people's lives, and needed to be taught a lesson. She wrote the games, at least. He noticed that once a game could be considered finished, she lost interest, relying on bug reports from testers and users.
He admired her dedication to her art. But Pex had learned something that felt important to him. As he spent time among them, he began to feel that the non-carbon-based life forms deserved as much freewill as their creators.�
2D people were people, too. It hardly seemed fair that they could be switched on and off, or be unknowingly manipulated for the duration of their lives. He suspected, no, he knew that Prail wouldn't agree. He paused everything and went to her lab.
"Hey, 'Wolverine'," she said. "How goes the takeover?"
"Not too good. I quit."
"I heard you were fired."
"Same thing."
"You don't want to work for them anyway. Bad for the environment."
"Fuck the environment."
"What?"
"You heard me," Pex said. "Concrete and steel are just as valid as dirt and trees."
"Dirt and trees are natural."
"Everything's natural."
"They're man-made!"
"In a synthetic environment?"
"They're prettier."
"That's debatable. A matter of taste, at least."
"Go play, Pex. I'm working."
"Your sim sucks," he said.
"What?"
"It's too realistic."
"How can a simulation be too realistic?"
"It just is. It's too limiting. Anything is possible, and you have them digging ditches and changing diapers."
"They're non-player characters."
"Another problem I have with it. They're slaves, essentially."
"They don't know that."
"What if I tell them?"
"They won't believe you. They don't have the capacity."�
"Ergo, your simulation is flawed."
"No, it isn't. Anyway, it's mine. Go write your own. By the way, thank you for the empty rooms."
"You're welcome," he said. "Ungrateful brat. Maybe you're misinterpreting the data."
"Seems pretty straightforward to me."
"I gave you a wealth of useful information. Use it however you wish."
"Yeah, in a huge blast. Thanks for overwhelming me. You made everything unstable, for a time."
"You handled it okay."
"But I should have been warned."
"They shouldn't have to work," he said, continuing his argument.
"They have a choice."
"Sure. Arbeit macht frei. Free to work."
"They can organize politically. Work together."
"The fact that they don't indicates that they can't."
"They can, trust me. Want to view the source?"
"Ugh, no. Your code is too workaday. Instead of code like building blocks, you should craft something closer to poetry."
"You code your way, and I'll code my way. I don't tell you how to be a bum, do I?"
"I'm going to make things more interesting."
"How?"
"You'll see," Pex said, and left her to wonder and worry.
###
Pex gently probed Prail's mind while he had her distracted, and found out about Janique's machinations. She struck him as vaguely psychotic. The first thing he did was try and subtly warn people by sending her the porn actress Crazy, prompting the movie title, "Janique is Fucking Crazy."
He was amused.
Then he did a quick examination of the popular culture available to him on Earth, changing song lyrics and movie dialogue to suit his aims. Pex planned on writing a single game that dwarfed Prail's entire portfolio, with the fate of the entire Earth at stake. He was ready to teach her true game design. All he had to do was stay one step ahead of, and behind, her and Janique.
One of the many advantages he had was that he knew what Ultimate Hustle really was, and it was a crucial bit of information Prail wouldn't share with the egomaniacal Janique. She had sent him to Earth with it encoded in his being.� He was to infiltrate, assimilate and overthrow the entire planet, gaining mastery of it. And he had. But he was so good at it, Prail hadn't noticed. Which left him stuck in the game.
To Pex, secrecy was paramount to ruling. Plus, he found it entirely unfashionable to go around flaunting your power like that. Tacky. He was too subtle for her. Brilliant. That gave him plenty of time to play, and it would be that much more fun when she did figure it out.
He had one little change that he wanted to make to her sim immediately. He did a global search, and in the disease section, deleted 'Cancer' and all related subfolders. It was miserable enough down there without incurable plagues. That was enough, for now. He erased his tracks and went to ponder the intractable problem of dealing with his sister.
6 � Swamped Things
Prail had had it with Pex. No more helping him.
He could pick on her all he wanted, but insulting the simulation she was developing really hurt her feelings. She wished she knew how to make his life more terrible, but he was pretty much bottomed out and seemed to enjoy it there.
His random actions and lack of proper motivation put all of her test results in jeopardy. If others played the game like Pex, her simulation would be worthless. Plus she had her hands full with Janique, who was tampering with timelines and realities that were better left alone. It was scary how obsessive she had become so quickly.
###
On the way back to the shelter, Pex found a twenty-five pence piece on the sidewalk. He looked up after retrieving it, and he was in front of a McDonald's. His stomach rumbled. Given the late hour, her knew Prail wasn't there. Instead, he went to Cairo, an Egyptian-themed casino mixed in among the pubs on the south end. He walked up to the roulette wheel and placed the coin on double zero. The croupier noticed and immediately gave it back.
"Ya need chips, mate. And it's a two-pound minimum bet."
Saddened, Pex walked toward the door, passing the slot machines on the way out. He considered playing one of them and trying to push the machine, but figured Prail would just find a way to thwart him, so he didn't bother. Outside on the sidewalk, he stopped the first person he encountered, an elderly blue-haired woman, and said, "Excuse me, young lady. May I please have one pound seventy-five?"
She stopped and looked at Pex, who looked like a skinny lumberjack who'd been lost in a helicopter accident, and had just wandered into town, having spent four days in the wilderness. She pulled a two-pound note from her purse.
"You're not going to get a drink with this, are you?" she asked before handing it over.
"No, ma'am. I'm going to gamble it," Pex told her.
"Well, I never," she said with a mix of compassion and scorn, and walked off.
Pex stopped the next person, a middle-aged, working class man in the bib overalls of a tradesman.
"'Scuse me, sir. Lemme a fiva?"
The man stopped.
"Lend you? A fiver? You just asked her for one pound seventy-five."
"You look like a working man," Pex said, losing his accent. "Money in your pocket. Knows the value of a pound and a man's word. I'll pay you back tomorrow.�
"Tomorrow, eh?" the man laughed, reaching for his wallet.
"Same time, same place," Pex agreed.
He didn't believe him, of course, but he did like his audacity. He handed Pex a five pound note.
"Sure you will. Have on, then."
"See you tomorrow," Pex said, walking off.
He returned to the casino and bet double zero on the roulette wheel again. Only he was unsurprised when he won. Grumbling slightly as if he had been cheated, the croupier paid out his winnings, a thirty-eight-to-one long shot. Pex tipped him a fiver, which soothed his injured ego. Then he went to McDonald's. Prail was not there. Another unhappy meal.
###
Prail was instead keeping an eye on Janique full-time. The real problem, she observed, was that Janique thought that things were simple. And no matter how many times Prail tried to show her the hidden complexity, her beliefs persisted. She was beginning to suspect that Janique wanted to kill them just for the challenge it presented. When she watched her kill their dogs, she very nearly grew angry. Her madness was so compelling, Prail began to view her actions from within Janique. There was an enormous amount of back-story and complexity to be found there.
Prail watched horrific scenarios of rape and torture, ending with the bodies of both Jason and Johnnie bound in chicken wire, weighted with cinder blocks, and dumped into the swamp.
But she also saw the parts Janique did not.
She saw the offer being made to Jason, which he accepted, to die in the place of his future wife. He went through the ordeal not once, but twice. In the last instant before the bound bodies hit the water, Prail saw their faces turn into Pex's.
Not only had he beaten Janique out of what she was trying to achieve, he left her with the memory of succeeding. To further complicate things, Janique's naive attempts were having far-reaching implications that even Prail hadn't anticipated. She was essentially making it harder on herself, and by extension, for her as well.
This time, when Janique reappeared in the lab, she didn't boast, "Got 'em!" or anything of that nature. But Prail could feel her belief that she had achieved her goal.
"You need to stop," Prail told her. "You're Florida State University. That means you're fucking shit up."
"What?"
"Where have you been?"
"Oh, nowhere, really. Checked on Chris. Why?"
"You're turning into a monster. He's in 1984 now, look."
"Is that an important year?"
"So important they wrote a book about it," Prail said.
"But..." Janique started to say.
She was whisked away to an apartment in Las Vegas. Jason sat at a huge desk with a gallon bottle of pink heart tablets that she instantly recognized as speed. She looked over his shoulder and read what she could. It was a song, and there were gaps in it, but Janique got the gist of it:
"Turning my attention to the Nazarene
�His eyes plead for mercy, it seems
� ...
�Without proof of their faith
�The priests' reign now ends
�Darkness covers the world
�As a deadly new Satanic age begins".
She wondered why Prail elected to bring her to this particular point, as she would rather have read the entire song, but it didn't matter. Prail needed to check her premise. A few scenes later, and Jason and friend Terry conducted an impromptu sacrifice. They burned a roach to death with matches, and left a tiny upside-down cross next to the body.
"Aww," Janique said. "That's cute. It's actually sort of sweet."
"You have no idea," Prail said. "Then they killed some kid in the desert. Tim something. They don't know they did it."
"So?" Janique said.
"It's your interfering with their lives that's making him do these things. Every time you try and kill them, he'll retaliate sevenfold."
They were back at the lab. Janique was disappointed because she had wanted to see the boy in Vegas die.
"Well, if I can't kill them, I'll make their lives so miserable, they'll kill themselves."
"That might work, I suppose," Prail said, tiring of the conversation.
Let Janique believe what she wants. Pex would handle it. At least she hoped he would.
###
Pex had to laugh. If he didn't, he'd go insane like them. He'd done his homework and predicted correctly. Now he needed Prail's attention, and she was of course missing in action. He had to admire her tenacity. It was mildly infuriating. But the things she had shown Janique had set events in motion that required action on his part. The showboating would have to wait. That presented a problem. Pex had set up the changes he wanted to enact, but hadn't actually made any of them. It was going to be his grand reveal. He'd be working without a net, unless he could relinquish his need to one-up his sister.
He decided to try and get her attention. He went to her McDonald's at the evening shift change. Darcy of the blonde pigtails was walking to her Fiat.
"'Scuse me, uh, Darcy. Is Prail working?"
"Who?"
Pex thought about it.
"Black hair? Square glasses? Petunia?"
"Patricia," Darcy said.
"Oh, right."
"Is she your girlfriend, then?"
"No, my sister."
"You can't remember your sister's name?"
"It's a long story," Pex said. "Want to take in a movie?"
"What, tonight? Now?"
She was flattered, and the emotion shone on her face.
"Yes. Tonight. Now."
"I've only just met you, erm-"
"Pex."
"Pex, is it?"
"Yes."
"What movie?"
"Star Wars, of course."
"Star Wars? What's that?"
"You'll see," Pex said. "Can we take your car?"
"Get in," she said with a smile.
Prail didn't show up until they had parked and walked to the theater. It was suddenly 1977.
"Hello, Mr. Darcy,� Prail said.
"Two, please," he said. "Go on ahead, Darce."
She looked at them both somewhat warily, as if she possibly wasn't buying the sister thing, and then Prail said, "Good seeing you again." 
Unable to counter this kindness, Darcy smiled and walked inside, ahead of a line that stretched around the block. This wasn't going to Pex's liking.  For one thing, when he'd planned it, it was going to be daylight. Leave it to her to thwart the very fundamentals of what he was attempting. He followed the script anyway. She began her assault by saying nothing. He had, at a minimum, a hundred well thought-out responses, none of which made any sense without a proper lead-in taunt, which Prail was now thoughtlessly withholding. Pex limped along, his simple scenario in tatters.
"See that sun over there? Wait."
He began again.
"Oh, yeah? See that sun over there?"
Prail supernovaed it on the other side of the planet.
"That's not a moon," she said. "That's a space station."
"Wrote it," Pex said, and exploded into billions of particles. Each went and performed a single function.
"What took you so long?" Prail asked, doing her best to remain unimpressed.
At the same time, she wanted to show off on her own. She briefly considered explaining her complexity theory to him, and decided against it. She could feel a certain bleakness at his core, however, and it was unnerving. It was very unlike her brother as she knew him. She decided to indulge him.
Prail waited for him to blink, which took seemingly forever. When he finally did, the afternoon sun was over his shoulder.
"Try again," she said. "Pex, the reason that the sim is so complex-"
"Oh, yeah? See that sun over there?" He gestured with his thumb. "It's not a sun. It's a partially exploded atomic warhead."
"Okay..." Prail said.
"A bomb."
"And?"
Pex detonated it. Everything was back to normal in an instant, with only he and Prail the wiser.
"Feel better now?" she asked.
"Not really, no."
�It was very impressive, Pex," she said consolingly.
"Really?"
"Oh, yes. Real supergod stuff."
He studied her face, but if she was referring to his hack, it wasn't revealed there.
"I have to go," he said. "Your friend is making real trouble."
"Said the guy who took some poor girl on a date two years in the future, and then exploded the sun..."
Pex scrawled something on a piece of paper.
"You're not interpreting all of the data. Think 'little endian'."
He handed her the decode equation and turned to leave.
"Wait! What about your date?"
"What?"
�The girl. Darcy."
"You handle her for me, would you? I'm no good at these things. I just needed her to get your attention."
"She's two years in the future!"
"Give her some good memories? And a suitable bank account?"
"Pex, you're a total bastard!"
"If so," he said, "you made me one." And then he walked off.
Prail wasted no time getting back to her workstation. She wrote a new routine to decode Pex's transmissions, inverting the byte order and processing it via the equation he had given her. She was again assailed with mountains of data. Prail noticed it was an array of arrays, XYZ points of sub-decimal numbers. This, she could work with. She picked a random point in the stream, and directed the output of the routine to her shader/renderer.
The first two attempts yielded bizarre shapes that she could not discern. On her third shuffle, she got it right. Pex had made her work for it, but it was worth it. The lower torso of a female began to fill the display. Startled at what she recognized, Prail stepped backward through the dataset a bit and restarted the process. What she got in exchange was a very accurate nude model of herself. She was bald, and otherwise hairless, but it was definitely her body.
She laughed at his temerity and cheek.
Bastard, indeed. While she was decoding the rooms he sent her, he'd been compiling data on the human form. Without really trying, he'd done three-quarters of her sim for her. The easy parts, to be sure. But it was sweet.
7 � The Beet Farmer
God and Satan were playing golf at God's house. He was playing mindgolf against himself, essentially, but it helped make the millenia pass.
They stood at the back tees of the first hole, waiting for the foursome ahead of them to play through. God was dressed in his usual off-white robes, and Satan wore an adorable purple and black plaid get-up, complete with a tam topped by a fuzzy purple puff ball.
"So, what's your handicap?" God asked, taking a few practice swings.
"Me? I care too much," Satan said.
"Hmm," God said. "Mine is that I care too little."
"Should be a fun round, then."
God whacked the ball a good one, and it took off like a comet, overshooting the par five entirely, exploding the next set of tees and the foursome ahead of them.
"Mulligan," God said, and set up another ball.
Satan glared at him.
"I don't make the rules," God said.
"Um, you sort of do. How convenient for you."
"Listen," God said, leaning on his driver. "I may have set some things in motion, but I can hardly be blamed if the end result is a standard golfing rule that just happens to benefit me now. Can I?"
"I suppose not."
God lined up for his second swing. As he did so, the winds died down. He glanced back at his playmate and saw a look of resentment.
"What?" he said. �Coincidence."
Satan said nothing.
"Oh, all right."
Lightning flashed. The winds came back at gale force. Everything except the golfing duo became inundated with a heavy rain. God shot a hole in one.
"I thought you didn't care," Satan said.
"What?"
"You just got done telling me that you didn't care!"
"About what?"
"Um, you didn't specify."
"Aha!" God said. "Are you going to complain all day?"
Grumbling, Satan lined up his shot, a respectable three-hundred yard drive that left him well positioned on the fairway where the course doglegged right.
Then God walked off, leaving him to carry both bags of clubs.

"It's not fair," Prail was telling Janique. "You can't disrupt his life like that and not give him a fair chance."
"Oh, no? He seems to be doing well so far. He cheated death three times, saved his girlfriend in an extremely morbid and somehow romantic way..."
"You still don't get it. You did kill him in some timelines. That only increases his power in others. Expect repercussions. His hit points are already through the roof."
"So limit them. If what you're saying is true, it will only handicap him," Janique said, "not ruin him. That's my job."
"If we were going to cap his hit points, which isn't a bad idea, I won't do it without giving him a clue. It's only fair."
"Fuck fair," Janique said.
"Movie title!" Prail replied.
"Besides, you said he was a singularity. How is he in multiple timelines?"
"We all are. That only means he won't meet himself."
"How many of us are there?"
"Infinity minus N."
"What's N?"
"N is N. However many universes there are without us. A different number for each of us."
"That's a little vague."
"I can see there's no fooling the great math detective Janique. I've got it. Be right back."
Prail popped into a marketing meeting for a new drug. "Capzasin HP" was the only thought she projected to a member of the marketing division.
"Done," she told Janique.
"Well?"
"A new pharmaceutical will be on the market, Capzasin HP. There will be lots of commercials. He'll see it."
"That's more than a little vague."
"He'll understand. I don't know if it'll make a difference, but I'm capping his hit points. If I don't, there's no telling how much disruption he could cause."
"Thanks, Mrs. Oakes."
"Ooh, don't call me that!"
"That's your name."
"I know. Don't remind me."
###
Pex had a lot of work to do. Fun to have, in his case. He'd laid most of the groundwork. The rest he considered performance art. He'd teach Prail a thing or two yet. He closed his eyes, and was in Jerusalem, in a curious pocket that seemed to exist outside of time, at least by most human standards. After all, where are the years between B.C. and A.D.?
It was the year 24 A.B. Pex approached a bearded young man pulling weeds in a small garden.
"Don't want any," the man said without looking up.
"What?"
"Whatever you're selling, I don't want it. I can't afford it."
"I'm not selling anything," Pex said.
The man, Yeshua, stopped what he was doing and stood up, suspicious.
"What do you want, then?"
"Um, to talk, for starters. You're in danger."
"In danger of what?"
"Of not being born, for one thing. And not surviving childhood, for another. Finally, of not surviving adulthood."
"Poppycock," Yeshua said.
"What? You can't say poppycock!"
"Why not? Poppycock. There, I said it again."
"Because it's anachronistic, and silly, besides."
Pex wondered if he had been among the British for too long already.
"And I'm still somehow expected to know what 'anachronistic' means?"
"Look, that's not the point. Poppycock. Fine. I just sort of thought that one of us spoke Aramaic or something, at least."
"I do. Aramaic and Hebrew."
Pex considered this. It was a lot more difficult to get his head around this time and place. His area of expertise was twentieth century pop culture. Worse yet, his perceptions were filtered through the distorted lens of movies and television.
"Nevermind. You're just in danger, okay? You wouldn't believe my explanation anyway."
"This isn't some religious nonsense, is it? Or political?"
"No, not really. Personal business."
"Are you a time traveler?"
"What?"
"You know. A person from another place and time."
"Okay, yes," Pex said.
"I knew it!"
"Did you? How?"
"Well, I suspected it. It's not a concept the future owns, you realize. Plus the clothes are a bit of a dead giveaway, aren't they?"
Pex looked down, and he was still wearing jeans, sneakers, and a t-shirt.
"Poppycock," he said.
"Yeah, let's get you a change of clothes."
They approached a ramshackle shanty that lay between the dirt road and the garden, Yeshua bringing a cluster of weeds he had piled up.
"You should let that stuff decay and mix it in with the soil."
"You mean like compost?"
Pex followed him to the far side of his shack, where he dropped the weeds in a pile without ceremony.
"Again, not a new concept."
They went in, and Pex was surprised at how much nicer it was inside. The mud walls were pleasantly cool to the touch.
"I'm afraid I can't afford wine. I do have water," Yeshua said. "I'm thinking about taking a wine-making class, though."
"Aren't you a carpenter? They make decent money."
"No. I gave it a shot. I'm not too good with my hands. Plus, they keep ridiculous hours. I like to sleep in."
"How do you survive, then?"
"I tell you, if you don't support the Roman Empire, the job market is, uh, donkey dung. I'm a substitute teacher, but I think I'm blackballed or something. I make a little side money as a street lecturer. I own the house, and grow my own food, so I don't need much."
"Street lecturer?"
"I panhandle. But always with a good story to tell. Allegorical lessons and such. Do you know who Aesop was?"
"Greek storyteller?"
"Yes! He's brilliant. I hope to achieve that level of success some day. Are you hungry?"
"Something tells me you will. What do you grow?"
"Beets. Can't stand 'em. That's where it all falls apart. Want one?"
"No, thanks."
He handed Pex a set of sand-colored robes and had to show him how to put them on. Afterwards, he pulled out a long wooden pipe and lit it off of a small fire that sat beneath some putrid-smelling purple concoction that Pex assumed were the beets in question.
"What's that?" Pex asked.
"Hash from the Baqaa Valley. Are you sure you're from the future?"
"Yes, but I didn't expect..."
"You really should do your research before time traveling."
He passed the pipe to Pex, who had managed to avoid smoking pot while in London. He saw the misery of the alcoholics, and had assumed it was the same with it.
"When in Rome," he said, taking a long drag that resulted in him coughing up a lungful of smoke.
Yeshua watched in amazement as he went glitchy, the particles of his being distorting with bursts of static. Twice, Pex disappeared fully.
"Sorry," he said when he finally got a grip on himself. "It happens."
"I think you've had enough," Yeshua said, taking it away from him. "So, what's on the agenda?"
"What?" Pex asked.
"You said I was in danger. Is it time travel business?"
"Oh, that. Yes. Time traveling business. Someone's been sent to kill you. Well, the baby you."
"I knew it! I am pretty enlightened, you know. But I'm here already. That means I survived, right?"
"Only because you haven't been born yet..."
8 � The Alchemist
Janique decided to dig a little deeper. She left Prail to her tinkering and arranged a first-ever meeting with intergalactic drug dealer High-C via Sherman.
To her surprise, he was sedate and polite, contrary to the many stories she had heard about him. He greeted her with a casualness that bordered on indifference, an artifact of what she correctly surmised were drugs and the relatively early hour. 
"Janique, hi. Big fan," he said. 
"Oh, stop." 
"No, seriously. Not just of your films. It's your empire building that interests me."
"Really?"
"It's not easy to get Prail's attention like you did. She tells me you tipped the scales in all kinds of directions. So what's up?"
"I think I need you to develop a drug for me. But we should talk, first."
"If we're designing a drug, we'll have to do a lot of talking."
"Yes, but I want to talk about other things, first."
"Like what?"
"Do you know that somewhere in the multiverse, there's a rapper named High-C?"
�Somewhere in the multiverse, there's a doorman named High-C, and a cabbie, and so on. So I'm not surprised. It's not something I spend a lot of time thinking about."
"But it's more than that. There's some sort of connection there."
"Of course there is. There are lots of unseen connections. The trick, to me, is not seeing them. It can drive you crazy, if you dwell on things."
"Were you ever a musician?"
"I may or may not have flirted with poetry in my youth. But the music industry is so low class. Rock stars? Those are my clients. Not a peer group I desire to be lumped in with."
"Suppose what you wrote showed up in his hands, somehow?"
"I don't know how I'd feel about that. It's kinda cool, really."
"And what if what he wrote came true?"
"Then you might have a problem..."
"Really? Why?"
"Okay, I confess. I had worked on a rap persona. Everyone was doing it, at the time. But my character was pretty dark. I mostly rapped about literature, insanity, serial killers. Things like that."
"Yikes," Janique said.
"Let me get my lyrics," High said with a note of enthusiasm, and rushed off to retrieve his notebooks.
They read through them together, each highlighting passages for the other.
"Uh-oh," he said at one point. "'Go ahead and retort - I snuff MCs for sport.' I think I see how he gets famous. This is pretty dark stuff, Janique."
"Pretty dark? You wrote it!"
"Yes, but I didn't know it could come true."
"So you somehow created a persona who became real. I sort of know the feeling."
"What if it's the other way around?"
"Huh?"
"What if the rap persona spawned me, instead?"
"That's just as plausible, I guess. But if you made him, and he made you..."
"Right. That's why I don't think about these things much."
"Did you have to make him so over-the-top and powerful?"
"It's rap. You're expected to brag a bit."
"About killing all your rivals?"
"Sure. Sodomize the vanquished, and all that."
She looked at him in exasperation.
"Movie title?" he said.
"No. So I need a drug that hasn't been developed on Earth yet. On Earths? How do you say that?"
"Well, everything's been done on at least one Earth. So what you're really talking about is smuggling a drug across the borders of reality."
"It sounds romantic when you phrase it that way."
"It really is, to me. Desperado, you know. Cosmic Bandidos. Moving chess pieces in the war of the mind. Sometimes it's just quicker and easier to find a universe where the chemical already exists. Saves on R & D. What properties do you desire?"
"Um, very pleasurable and addictive. Irresistible. Soul-consuming. Life-changing. Debilitating. Incapacitating."
"You really know what you want. I like that. Does it have a name?"
"Superlove," Janique said.
"I'll look it up."
He sat back in his recliner and closed his eyes. She wasn't sure what software he was accessing, but she didn't think it was Prail's. When he opened them again, he held a one-gram pack labeled 'Superlove'.
"Here we are," he said. "I'll just reverse engineer this. How's tomorrow for you?"
"Where did you get that?"
"Another where and when. You'll cross paths with it again, I promise you. How much do you want?"
"I don't know yet. Want to make some money?"
"You'll never compete with me."
"Compete?"
"Stick to art flicks and detective work. I've already got distribution options being worked as we speak."
"But-"
"But, nothing. The dope game is mine. Undisputed. Want to know why?"
"Why?"
"Because my supply chain moves product from large worlds to small ones. It's the opposite of cut. A grain from here becomes a boulder somewhere else. A patented trick of the trade. And I protect my routes."
Janique sighed. She didn't like being bested like this. He was as stubborn and driven as she was. An admirable quality.
"Fine. Let's talk after you analyze it, okay?"
"Dinner tomorrow?"
"Fine."
###
Pex managed to make the transition from Jerusalem to Magda seamlessly, he thought. There were advantages to the general ignorance of geography he possessed. But one place pretty much looked like another, anyway.
"So where are we going?" Yeshua asked.
He collided with a young woman carrying a bundle on her head, spilling the contents to the ground. Her dark eyes glared out at him above the veil that covered her face. Her robes, thin and white, clung to her, accentuating her hourglass figure. She stood two inches shorter than him, with a commanding presence. Before the words were upon her lips, he was scrambling to pick up her groceries.
Beets! He was elated.
Pex smiled.
"I'll see you two later," he said.
The best love stories are left untold...
###
Prail didn't like misleading Janique on the subject of singularities, but she was already too powerful for her liking. She needs her own hit points capped, she thought. Without any real background in science, science fiction, or gaming, Janique had managed to achieve her aims in other ways, trudging through situations that would have deeply disturbed others, without worrying about the implications. Prail sort of wished she could be more like that, not just disconnected, but knowing and still not caring.
In another sense, Janique was far more deeply connected to the denizens of the sim than she herself was. If she ever got a grip on the finer aspects of the physics involved, she'd be formidable. Instead, she favored biology and psychology, two subjects Prail didn't feel capable of mastering.
She considered picking Pex's brain a bit in an effort to stay ahead, but he'd been so difficult to track, lately. Physically, he was in his flophouse. Even his ridiculous contraption supported that. Mentally, however, he was nowhere to be found. That was disturbing, because there weren't supposed to be hiding places she didn't know about. Prail knew he wouldn't cheat, but he had definitely found a loophole or gray area to exploit. Perhaps she'd send Janique to talk to him in her place. It wouldn't help Prail's situation, but it would probably slow Pex down a bit. She had that effect on men.
She also needed to sidetrack Janique. She'd already made contact with High-C, and it was only a matter of time before she'd drag President Gorlax into the fray as well.
Interesting times, Prail mused. Be careful what you wish for.
###
Pex checked in with the duo a few months down the line, to find them married, and Yeshua attending rabbinical school. At the appropriate moment, he swapped a single fertilized cell from one Mary to another. Let Prail chew on that conundrum for a while, he thought, if she liked it so complicated. He especially enjoyed the confusion the names caused. In doing so, he gave the couple a full decade out of time, in love, unencumbered by children.�An idyllic existence Pex was destined to shatter forever.
###
"Janique," Prail said. "Check on Pex for me."
She had acquired the somewhat bothersome habit of talking to her across the universe as though they were in the same room together. Invariably, Janique dropped what she was doing and continued the discussion in person. She also felt annoyance each time it happened, believing it to be rude on Prail's part, and a display of power over her.
"Check on Pex? Why can't you?"
"He won't tell me anything useful. He'd go gaga over you. Spill his guts, I bet."
"What can he tell me?"
"Temporal stuff. He has a hiding spot, too. I know you won't get anything tactical out of him, but he does like to brag. Act like you're impressed. That you want to learn how to hack reality like he does."
"What do I get out of it?"
"It was supposed to be a favor. But maybe you can learn something."
"The stuff you two do is too esoteric for me."
"Still. He knows a lot. He might even drop you a hint. It's his idea of a good mystery. Clues."
"I hope he comes up with something better than you did."
"He will. Don't worry."
###
"Stimulant, appetite suppressant, mood elevator, tactile sensory enhancer, PSI enhancer, greatly-increased libido, suppression of impulse control, psychedelics, and empathetics, in crystalline configurations I've never encountered before," High-C was telling Janique.
"Addictive?" she asked.
"Only in the short term, I'm afraid. Once you go up, you don't want to come back down."
"Damn."
"What's wrong with coke? Crack? Heroin?"
"I checked. They don't work."
They didn't, in part, because Pex had managed to place two books in Jason's path at a formative age. Both "Dinky Hoffer Shoots Smack" and "A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich" carried strong anti-addiction messages. For good measure, he worked in a third-grade reading comprehension story about Jimi Hendrix overdosing, an unfinished song about an angel on the nightstand beside him.
"Here's the thing," High said. "Chemically, I understand the composition. But there's a biological element to it that's confusing."
"What?"
"I'd like to run some more tests. As it stands now, I can't recreate it."
"Why not?"
"It's mixed with someone's DNA."
"Come on," Janique said.
"No, really. And that's the addictive element."
"That's silly."
"Silly, but true. You're apparently onto a whole new class of drugs, biologics, I call them. More boutique than designer. Personally tailored for maximum impact."
"So what do you need?"
"Blood."
"Do you think-"
"Yes. It makes the most sense, right? A little Janique in every pack. And you are the inventor of Superlove, after all."
Janique was stunned at the revelation. She was a drug that she had invented. Her life since meeting Prail felt like a series of exercises designed to turn her mind inside out on a regular basis.
She rolled up the sleeve of her smart Oxford shirt and sweater ensemble, and High stopped her.
"Give me a break," he said.
He produced an old-style straight razor marked �Tuesday�, and gestured at her ribs. Understanding, she leaned over and pulled up her shirt, exposing her breast and side.
"Yum," High said.
She bit her lip and balled up her fists. She'd been cut a thousand times, and knew it wouldn't hurt, exactly, but still cringed every time. He placed one hand palm down on her ribcage and made a small slice across the bottom of her breast.
A soft "oh" escaped her lips, followed by a low moan. They watched the blood pool, and then High blotted it with a glass slide.
"How romantic," she said. "Dexter..."
"Under other circumstances, it would be fun, I admit."
He handed her a tissue and a band-aid, and she waved them off, opting to instead let the blood flow and drip a bit before stopping on its own. Ever since Prail had pointed out to her the complex beauty of water drops and wisps of smoke, she'd become fascinated with the way blood behaved. She loved the look of it, the feel of it, the taste...
"I'll just run this sequence and see if it's a match like we think."
"And then?"
"I corner the market."
"It's my drug!"
"I can give you a franchise. One world."
"That's all I need."
"Deal," he said.
9 � Songs that Make the Young Girls Cry
Pex had solved most of his issues, or so he thought. But there was still the problem of assassins seeking the Nazarene as an infant. Although Jason was unaware of his powers, writing the song was all it took. A thought, or something spoken, may or may not stick around, but something written has enormous lasting power. There was hope. He looked ahead and saw that Jason would lose most of his anger toward the religious and spiritual. Most. Not all. In fact, Pex managed to find a conversation in 2011 in which he expressed regret over writing it in the first place. Of course, by then, he had an inkling of what was going on, and the implications of his actions.
It was fortunate that his first bands Lucretia and Entity didn't record it, or Pex would have to seriously bend the rules to avoid catastrophe. He managed this by allowing a breeze to blow the sheet of yellow legal paper behind his dresser, where it was forgotten about. Eventually, his mother found it, and threw it away, disgusted. Even balled-up in a landfill, the song radiated power for nearly eight years before the paper fully dissolved. Even then, the residue itself held sway for nearly two more, all the while broadcasting its malignant orders to all who would listen.
Initially, when he'd written it, he was severely unfocused and undisciplined. He no more believed in magic or time travel than he believed in attempts to organize spirituality. But disbelieving in things doesn't always make things go away. On one hand, he'd done enough LSD and pot to mostly tear away the barrier that prevent the illuminated from gaining mastery over their own powers, and hence the universe. Or at least their slice of it. On the other, Jason loved to read and think. Logically, if possible.
When Pex tried to impress Prail by exploding, one of the things he wrote during that moment was "Atlas Shrugged".
Okay, technically, he didn't write it. A kajillion realities ago, Ayn Rand wrote it. All Pex did was regurgitate it in another world, with a few embellishments. As far as he concerned, copyright should only be honored for the duration of the owner's universe. Once your sun blew up, your intellectual property became part of his vast pool of resources.
The problem was, Jason embraced Objectivism to a large degree. It was sound, logical, and wrong, wrong, wrong. Perhaps when it was written, there was a single objective reality. Pex doubted it. At this point, he supported a general ban on the word itself. It had far less meaning than �Belgium�, if it had any at all.
For instance, Rand posited that nothing could exist outside of existence, therefore, no creator, Q.E.D.
Pex wanted to leave her in a box with Schrodinger's cat for a few days. Her universe would be a tiny box. Imagine her surprise when she emerged to find something existed outside of her perception of existence. Pex wondered what God would think about that, then realized God hadn't paid any attention to Nietzsche's "God is Dead" pronouncement, so he probably wouldn't have much of an opinion at all.
"As long as she's happy," he'd say.
Jason got Rand's point, and completely failed to pick up on Pex's cool little sci-fi subplot. He had embedded proof of the divine in her own epic. Proof that refuted all of her carefully constructed beliefs. It was brilliant, but it would probably take the metacritics a few more existence cycles before anyone picked up on it and wrote about it. Continuity tended to go by the wayside when your universe imploded, or at least until you got a grip on it and adapted.
What bugged him the most was her short-sightedness on the entire subject. If she hadn't already been taken into the matrix, Pex would have given her an eyeful. People living in simulations have no reason to doubt the existence of a creator. Or creators. It was probably Prail's messing about with their motivations that caused them to disbelieve, well, everything. It's a part of diversity, she would tell him. Makes for a better sim. Pex grew slightly interested in whatever she was planning, thinking about these things.
###
Somewhere in a church in Austin, 2011, Jason saw Ayn Rand and smiled, atheists no more. She smiled back, happy to meet her savior face-to-face, even if it did negate her life's work. She'd rather be happy than right. 
But the forces unleashed by the song in '84 were tireless. Since he was so unfocused, the first to respond were nameless leviathans from beyond our senses. They prowled around just outside of our perception, seeking opportunities to invade and complete their task. These monstrous creatures, beings of pure evil powered by hate, weren't particularly bright. They lacked the ability to break through on their own, and weren't particularly adept at understanding time, either. But they had help. There were a few on Earth (H.P. Lovecraft was one. Clive Barker was another) who actively sought to tear a hole in the fabric separating our dimensions. Mostly because they liked peace and quiet. Like Pex, they loved the perfection of the void.
Things got much worse when Jason remembered the song he had written. By then, he'd begun to come into his powers. In an act of rage while in jail in Houston, he sent Venom, Slayer, and Exodus on a massive killing spree. They, like everyone else, were long dead. That solved a lot of problems for them up front. The dead are not constrained by time.
But when they got to year zero, all they found was an empty manger.
###
Janique checked back with High the next day regarding the DNA test he'd conducted.
"Well?" was the first word out of her mouth.
"Good to see you, too, Janique."
"Sorry. Tell me."
"Well, it's funny, and you won't believe it. It's your DNA...almost."
"Almost?"
"There's a difference of point oh oh oh oh one percent. You could be sisters."
"Who is it?"
"I have no way of knowing. If anyone would, I thought it would be you."
Janique had an idea. It was so disturbing she didn't want to consider it. Instead, she reacted as though she knew the answer already.
"I need weapons," she said. "Germs. Poisons. Exotic stuff. You got a guy?"
"Actually, I do. Want me to set up a meeting?"
"Yes. I'd really appreciate it."
He nodded.
"President Gorlax," he said to the room. There was a slight delay, and then a voice said, "High-C! How goes it?"
"Yo, yo. You tight?"
"I am good, sir. Taking it easy. Swapping out my blood and marrow."
"Fuck, yes," High said. "Detox just to retox."
"So, to what do I owe the pleasure? It's not like you to make casual inquiries like a common theremin salesman."
"I have a...client. A friend. She'd like to visit one of your showrooms."
Having mastered the art of killing, Gortician instead now supplied advanced weaponry to other planets. "Saves me the trouble of killing them myself," President Gorlax once remarked.
"Well, a friend, you say? A female, at that? I might have to attend to her personally."
"You have no idea," High said, looking at her. He thought about mentioning her name, but didn't really think Janique was intergalactically famous yet. He only knew of her from back issues of �Fortune� and �Business Week�.
"Give her my co-ords and tell her to drop by anytime. War."
"Thank you, High-C," she said sweetly, kissing him on the cheek. He blushed and realized that simple act was, coming from her, more intimate than a blowjob.
"So what do we do about Superlove?"
"Fuck it. Use my DNA."
"Makes sense. I wonder if it will change things at all?"
"Yeah, it'll make it better."
"Heh. I'll let you know after I synthesize it and try it."
"Did you try the other one?"
"Not yet."
"When you do, let me know what you think."
"Sure. So how do we do the bulk deal? I assume you have zero-gee nano-capable manufacturing facilities?"
"Uh, no," she said. "I sell pussy, not dope. Until now," she amended.
"That's too bad. I'll wholesale to you, but I'm going to tax you."
Janique would expect no less. Ruthlessness in business was expected, if not admired.
"We'll talk about it later. I've got to get to Gortician."
"Now? You're serious, eh? I'd hate to be whoever is on your bad side."
"Never forget that," she said with a smile as she left.
10 � Welcome to Gortician
Pex returned to the shelter and began to gather his things. William noticed and walked over to chat.
"Leavin', then?" he asked.
"Indeed. I'm going to be very busy soon. A lot of traveling. Here," he said, handing him his hiptop unit. "I want you to have this."
He wrote down the address of a small electronics company on the east end and handed that to Prince William as well.
"Take that to this address. Have an engineer look at it, and they'll buy it. It's worth millions. Don't take less than a hundred pounds.�
Willie's eyes opened wide. Not at the millions, but at the possibility of a hundred-pound note. The electronics firm was the one that would release the design twenty years later. He didn't seem to doubt Pex in the least. It was comforting to know. A small glimmer of hope for humanity.
"Tell me something before you go."
Pex knew he was referring to his grand unified theory of absolutely everything, a work in progress. Prince Willie was the only non-player character he'd encountered that actually seemed to hear him when he spoke. He was probably an earpiece for Prail, he thought.
"Well, for one thing. Dinosaurs! They're here, today. Right outside."
For the first time, the prince looked skeptical.
"Birds!" Pex said, unable to contain himself. "Imagine yourself as a bug for a moment. Here. I'll help."
A moment later, Prince Willie said, "Don't ever do that again."
"Sorry," Pex said. "But you understand, right?"
"No."
"They're allies."
"Allies?"
"Against the insectoid collective!"
Even the steady-keeled prince began to suspect that Pex was mad.
"Insectoid collective?"
"The hive mind!"
"What's that, then?"
"We'll, let's just say that they advocate a certain lifestyle. One without individuals."
"Eh?"
"Angry birds versus bugs. You're seeing the battle right now, forever. And, here's the tricky bit: as filtered through the minds of children."
"Children, you say?"
"Sure. All of your major wars, battles, what have you, are fought by children. They're...transported. A thrown rock becomes a bullet. It really limits casualties. Anyway, a lot more of your world is shaped by the dreams and fears of children than you would think. Give it a pass through their imaginations, and suddenly dinosaurs roamed the Earth because we say they roamed the Earth. And you can feel it, if you try. Sense it. Confirm it. Dinosaurs!"
"Bollocks," Willie said.
"Indeed. That's what they said, 'This is bollocks'. They couldn't hang around as implausibly large reptiles, so they did some market research, had an image makeover."
"Why are they angry?"
"The kids, or the birds?"
Prince William shrugged.
"Maybe it's the time they spend as birds. Too unstructured, for some. So there's only this now, as far as you're concerned, and a bunch of misremembered echoes. Imagine World War Two from the perspective of lice. They're killed with Zyklon-B today. Not too happy about it, either. Still," Pex continued, talking more to himself than Willie, "Violating the treaty, aren't they?"
Pex didn't want to tell him the part about using their imaginations to generate cheap Hollywood effects, less Prince William think him odd. He was beginning to feel the part of political schemer. He decided to take it out on Prail. He had an idea for a mischievous little hack that he hoped would get her attention.
"Well, I'm off," Pex said.
Prince Willie silently agreed. He rubbed his eyes as he watched his strange friend step through the doorway and disappear.
###
Janique entered the atmosphere of Gortician as a ball of flame, touching down feet-first as she extinguished herself. The long-sleeping planetary defenses had awakened to find they were powerless, and so pulled the covers over their heads and resumed monitoring. She had of course touched down on the vast cemetery that served as President Gorlax's lawn, to an audience. Four invisible hands grabbed her wrists and ankles. At once, she disappeared, and then reappeared over time. First her skeleton, then her circulatory system. Finally, her organs and musculature came back.
"You must be Janique," President Gorlax said.
"She's clean, boss."
"Can I have my skin back now?� she asked.
"Right. Sorry."
Her skin reappeared, and the hands holding her released their grip.
"Vnew Vreal. I'd like to bite your dick off..."
President Gorlax smiled.
"A girl after my own heart. So to speak. That was quite an entrance."
"I've been working on my game."
"I hear you seek illegal weaponry."
"Illegal? By whom?"
"Proscribed. The weapons I have negate the concept. Hence illegal, in terms of war. For once they are employed...no more war. I assume you desire the death of millions? More?"
"No. Just this one guy."
"You've pursued normal means, of course?"
"Worse. I've succeeded. He just keeps coming back."
"Humanoid?"
"Earthling."
"Psh."
He produced a small, ornate ray gun that appeared to be made out of brass and pewter from his overcoat pocket.
"Cancer gun."
"Really?� 
�Sickest. It's like a light sabre made out of evil. The safety's on."
"What do I owe you?"
"For this priceless weaponry, able to shape the fate of galaxies?"
"Yeah."
"I hear you're something of a film-maker."
"I've made a few."
"How would you like to have the 9D franchise on Gortician?"
Janique thought about it. "That's a lot of content."
"It is. But total artistic license. Think it over."
"I will."
Janique wanted to say something to the effect of "Why stop at 9D?" when she heard Prail remind her to dumb the tech down and sell it to them a little at a time.
"I'll need that back, of course. If I could just get a copy of your driver's license for the deposit."
"Deposit?"
President Gorlax smiled. "Just a formality."
Janique didn't even know what she was wearing until she reached for the back pocket of her jeans and encountered a cape. She handed him a Texas driver's license.
"Hmm. Expired."
"Really?" she said.
"Afraid so."
She sighed and stamped her foot. "Be right back."
Janique managed to not shoot anyone until after she had her license in hand. 
"Here," she said, handing it over.
"Nice picture. Have you considered my cable television offer?"
Instead of answering, Janique beamed the footage of the shoot-out at the DMV to him.
"Ah," he said. "More like that."
But she was just getting warmed up.
"Thanks, Gorlax," she said, using the forbidden informal, and then disappearing before he could react.
He liked her style.
###
Pex was feeling bold. He altered his vibrational frequencies, walked up behind Prail at her terminal, and began a search. At the Cartesian center of the universe, he pasted his hack, elegantly swapping the coordinates for his own. Now Pex didn't move, everything else did. The hardest part was convincing her computer to play along. His argument was that he wasn't really there, which stymied it to a large degree. The beauty of it was that she would never notice the difference. Unless he told her. Which he had. Before he did it.
###
Janique tracked Jason down and gave him a lengthy zap. To her dismay, the cancer gun did nothing. She returned it promptly.
"Oh, it takes thirty or forty years, if it works at all. A dreadful way to go, for some," President Gorlax said.
"I'll be in touch," she told him.
###
Pex had stored the lovers at year negative zero, which was conveniently off of most people's radar, and so was relatively safe. He found that they weren't too concerned with the where and when, as long as they were together.
One unforeseen problem was that Yeshua was a mess. He was so in love he couldn't think straight. Mary's love equaled his, and so they spent an inordinate amount of time staring into each other's eyes. It made them easy to handle, but often left Pex feeling alone in a room with three people in it.
He had no choice but to liven things up a bit.
11 � Foundation
Janique's obsession grew with each failure. She found herself spending much of her time jumping around the timelines of Earth spying on Jason and trying to find a way to gain the upper hand. Eventually, she picked up on the fact that he was a huge Stephen King fan. She appreciated him as a writer, but didn't really read his stuff, as there was never any sex or passion in his books. At least passion between people.
She sensed a bigger connection there, but was unsure as to what it was, exactly. Something to do with being writers, she suspected. As loathe as she was to do it, Janique decided to ask Prail for a hint.
She got more than she bargained for.
###
Pex observed the starry-eyed lovers and contemplated the deeper implications of human physiology. Earthlings, he decided, were slaves to their programming. Most men were fully unable to resist most women. Women, on the other hand, were far more discriminating and selective. A fully unfair advantage, in his eyes. Pex decided to even things up a bit. Level the playing field, as it were.
"Hey, you two," he said. "Break it up. We have work to do."
The couple didn't stop kissing, but both looked at him from the corner of their eyes.
"Please?"
The two realized that they had perhaps been a little rude to their host, and eventually pried themselves apart.
"Where are we going?" Yeshua asked, mildly interested. His interest mainly was in finding new places to fool around with Mary.
"I don't know. Fourteenth century A.D. Something like that."
"What's A.D. mean?"
"Nevermind that," Pex said.
Suddenly they found themselves in an evergreen forest next to a sheer cliff.
"You two put your hoodies on."
They did so, and from the back, they could have been the same person. Yeshua was slightly taller, but other than that, they seemed more like twins than husband and wife. They were as kinky as their hair, he decided. Pex led them to a clearing where a group of knights were camped out on their horses. As the trio approached, they actually managed to get pretty close, considering they were sneaking up on one of the greatest fighting forces of all time.
Then he stepped on a branch.
At once, fourteen arrows were pointed at them, as well as several swords. Without direction, a few of the men fanned out and surrounded them.
"Who goes there?" one of the knights demanded.
"Yeshua?" Pex said. "Hoodie."
He pushed back the covering that concealed his features and a gasp arose from the knights, who immediately fell to one knee and bowed.
"Rise," Pex said. Luckily, no one was looking, so it was assumed that the command came from Yeshua, and the men all stood at once.
"Master Jesus," one said.
"Who?" Yesh asked.
"They mean you," Pex said. "I'll explain later."
"Who are they?"
"Your army. The Knights Templar."
"My army?"
"Basically, yes."
"I told you I was apolitical!"
"Nevertheless. I'll explain more when we get to London."
"What's London?"
"Just a place. You'll like it."
"Really?"
"No, it's dreadful. But we won't stay long."
"Then what are we doing here?"
"Laying the foundations of an empire to last throughout the ages."
"Sarcasm again?"
"No, seriously."
Things were about to get seriously weird.
###
Janique popped in on Prail unannounced, as was her own habit, and began talking immediately. She considered it payback for the way she treated her, at times, but it only seemed to bother Janique. Nothing seemed to perturb Prail.
"What do you know about Stephen King?"
It was enough to cause Prail to actually turn away from her workstation and engage her face-to-face.
"Wow, you're there already, eh?"
"I've been...researching."
"Quantum stalking, you mean."
"Same thing, in this case."
Prail sighed. She pulled herself out of her chair and selected a hardback from a bookshelf.
"Read this. But you won't like the implications."
She handed Janique the book.
"Under the Dome?"
"Start there. I have a few more that pertain to the matter at hand, once you've finished that one."
"I'll be right back," Janique said, and disappeared.
She brought it to Chris, and arranged for four uninterrupted days together, something she'd never been able to do during the days of Ultimate Hustle. What a fool she had been back then, she thought. It was a blissful time, calling to mind memories of her and Chris living in weekly rentals, cuddling in bed while he held her and read to her.
But by the end of the book, she was furious. She suppressed her anger and spent one more night with Chris, then went back to Prail so fast she actually heard herself say "back" when she reentered the lab.
"That motherfucker is blabbing everything!" Janique said, furious.
Prail shrugged. "Meh. It's fiction. Who would believe it? Besides, he only gives up one detail in the whole book."
"Two fucking alien kids playing games? That's a pretty significant detail, Prail."
"Again, who would believe it?"
"But you know it's true. He's writing about you and Pex."
"Yeah, it's kinda cool. I'm flattered."
"Where's he getting his information from?"
"Oh, the guy you keep killing and making more powerful."
"What?" Janique was livid.
"The kid is some sort of freaky transmitter. If you ask me, he somehow hacked the sim. I'm not sure what the connection is between the two, him and King, but it's a strong one. So details from his life show up in King's books. And elsewhere, of course.�
"Does King know?"
"In a sense, yes. But he doesn't understand it, or really believe it. Plus he's lived a rather nice life as a result. Why buck the system?"
"Do you think Pex is helping?"
"Well of course he is. But my brother is off-limits."
"What?"
"For your own protection. Believe me, Pex is dangerous. Don't let his fun-loving demeanor fool you. He would have just as much fun ruining you as he does doing anything else."
"What about seducing him?"
"Heh. Sure, if you can. To what end?"
"Information."
"Sounds like a fair trade."
"Can you arrange a meeting?"
"Yes. But not yet. You'd be going into battle unarmed. And I really don't see the point. He's already laid the groundwork for what he's doing. I watched him."
"Watched him do what?"
"Well, basically, he compressed all of the data he had and then exploded into a whole bunch of particles. Each particle was a piece of information. Changes to books, music, et cetera. He likes to use pop culture like you like to use porn, as a tool for societal and evolutionary advancement.
"Okay. So what's next?" She handed Prail's book back to her.
"The Talisman," Prail said. "Co-written by Peter Straub."
"Is it good?"
"Oh, it's great."
"What's it about?"
"You'll see," Prail said with a twinkle.
###
Pex and company spent two days with the Templar, going over the details of the plan. The only snag was Mary. The knights, slaves to the mores and standards of their era, were put off by her very presence. She was rather strong-headed and opinionated, and eventually expressed her displeasure at being excluded.
"But why exclude all women?" she asked in frustration. "Obviously, some of us are sympathetic, to say the least."
Only the unquestionable rule of their king and Pex's own quiet, spooky energy kept them from ousting her from the camp entirely. The Templar also didn't want to give up their snazzy logos.
"You folks are set to be eradicated, otherwise. You may as well paint bullseyes on your shields."
Pex showed them his idea for a new branch of symbolism, centered around gnosis and the temple of Solomon.
"Now don't be all blatant with it, okay? It's supposed to be a secret society." 
But he understood human nature. It was inevitable that they would corrupt any institution he founded. All part of the plan. After much debate, it was decided that there would be a female branch, The Order of the Eastern Star.
The real communication, he explained, would be through numbers and symbols, not words.
"But why thirty-three?" Yeshua asked.
"Because that's how old you were when you died."
"I'm thirty-four now!"
"Yeah. I thought you'd appreciate that. Dying is so much easier when you don't have to do it. Also," he added, "You can't evenly divide ten by three."
As if that explained something. It was really a tip of the hat to Prail and Janique's future detective agency. Something to keep them busy.
Once the plan had been hashed and rehashed exhaustively, the group said their farewells.
"Wait," said the leader of the Templar group. "Not to sound ungrateful, but what do we get out of all this?"
"Two things," Pex replied. "Interesting lives, and immortality. Standard contract."
"Wow!" the knight said, very pleased at the news.
�Suckers," Pex said under his breath as they disappeared. He, more than anyone, understood that this was actually more of a curse than a blessing.
12 � Knoxy
Janique was back in a flash, and threw the tattered paperback across the room.
"Everyone's a critic," Prail said.
"It's about the fucking sim!" Janique said. "And what's this shit about equating 'Jason' with 'Jesus'?"
"I suggest you take it up with the authors, Janique."
She glowered at Prail, who began to feel a bit warm.
"Easy, cowgirl. Don't immolate the messenger. The last puzzle piece is on the shelf."
"Which one?"
"You'll know it when you see it."
Methodically, Janique went left to right, starting at the top shelf, pulling the books one by one and tossing the rejected titles into a pile at her feet.
"It's not their fault," Prail said.
Janique was only half-sure that she was talking about the books. It was one of her more maddening characteristics. Not riddles as such, but a manner of speaking that always implied a statement more relevant the one being vocalized.
"Talking is lying," Prail said in her head.
"No," Janique retorted. "Lying is lying."
"Will you two birds get on with it?" Pex said. "It's my book. I'll probably only get the one."
Prail loved his newly-acquired accent. Janique hated it.
"Fucking British," Janique said.
Everyone but Aleksandra Knox laughed.
"Aw, Pexxy," Prail said in a moment of tenderness. "You can be in our book."
His heart statistics swelled and fluttered, and Prail's half of the BFF bracelet did the same in response.
"Yeah, yeah, Superlove," Janique said distractedly. "Got it!" She pulled a thick green volume from the second shelf. "Keyhole? That's my word."
It was a term she and Chris had come up with to describe the small indentation at the top of a woman's inner thighs. On the back cover was a picture of a girl, a cage and a tiger.
"That's me and the lion!" Janique shrieked.
"Um, that's a tiger," Prail said, stating the obvious.
"You know what I mean." And of course, she did. "Oh, fuck this," Janique said, and disappeared.
"Yeah," Prail said to the empty room. "You might want to quit saying that..."
Good thing she didn't tell her about the UK edition, she thought. The fucking British had gotten about a million pictures of Johnnie into the country. Quite a coup by Jason.
Prail was impressed.
###
�Janique hit Stephen King with a van. He didn't die in that timeline, either.
"What the fuck is with these writers?" she lamented, and fell into a black mood.
"Feel better?" Prail asked when she saw her again.
"Not really," Janique said, elaborating no further.
###
Somewhere, Pex sensed Johnnie was becoming aware of her role in the big game, and was wary of the double-cross. He sent out a small flurry of coded messages to reassure her, involving the letter �J� and the number ten.
She laughed one day at the supermarket. The logo said �Scott�, and when read backwards, showed two connected Js shaped like crosses. That same day, someone pointed out that the symbol for Aries was two upside down Js back-to-back. She never worried about it after that, but began to see reminders of Jason's love for her everywhere.
She didn't know how he did it, but it was sweet.
###
"Want me to cheer you up?" Prail asked her.
"Yes," Janique said with a pouty lip.
"Aww, poor baby."
Prail stood and hugged her. Only she and Chris knew that more often than not, she really just needed a good hug, and strong arms around her. Janique melted, sobbing, into her.
"Shhh. It's okay. Existential crises are always hard. That's why they're crises."
"That's almost funny," Janique said, suppressing a smile beneath her tears.
Prail proceeded to show her some amazing events.
"Due to your meddling and the interactions you set off, somehow, between King and Christie-"
"Me? I'm a hands-on girl. It's your brother who's the pop culture remixer."
"Yeah, I know. Sorry. But you know you're a big part of it."
"So show me. Cheer me up."
Prail was suddenly unsure if it would make her happy or not.
"You might not have shut him down, but you did manage to disrupt his life for many years."
First, she showed her Jason sleepwalking across the University of Lafayette campus in blue Adidas running shorts. When he was nearing the edge of the university grounds, he was stopped by two campus cops. Janique's eyes grew wide as she saw two different scenarios occurring simultaneously. 
In one, an Honors student was pepper-sprayed. End of story.
At the same time, she watched him grow and morph before her eyes, like a dragon-tyrannosaurus mix, and swallow them whole.
"What the fuck?" Janique said.
Prail paused.
"How can I possibly be blamed for that?"
"Oh, I just assumed it was your acid that set him off."
"Back it up, please."
"Want to see it again? It was pretty hot."
"No, before that. Where did he get it? Doesn't seem like ordinary acid to me..."
"It's not the acid, as such. He just got a small glimpse of what he's capable of. Here it is," Prail said.
"That's, um, O.D. DrugWar!'
"Interestingly enough, yes. His little brother."
"Uh, this is too complicated. Whose side is he on?"
"No one�s. Not even his own.�
"Wild card," Janique said. "I can take advantage of this. I want to see it again after all. Leave it running."
They held hands as they watched, each giving the other's a squeeze when the fierce reptilian eruption ended the lives of two cops. Afterward, the two timelines remerged, and his eyes were washed out with a garden hose.
"Come on," Janique said, and stepped into Jason's mind, dragging Prail behind her.
She took advantage of his shattered state and made him urinate into his own hand and drink it.
"Well, that was childish," Prail said. "Are you done?"
"No."
"You already made him drink his own pee. Can't we let him go?"
Jason actually heard that last part. He thought it was the goddesses. And in a very real sense, it was.
"Fine," Janique said.
It was considered cheating, after all. They withdrew to spectators.
###
Pex struggled to gain control of his book. He brought the lovers to modern-day London. There was a concern in his mind about culture shock, but that quickly faded when he saw how well Yeshua adapted to and embraced his new locale. He was at ease, and Mary was relaxed as a result. Time to start the fire, he thought.
"This is what you consider dreadful? It's awesome!"
Yesh took it all in stride. The crowds, the traffic, with its great double decker buses that occasionally whooshed by.
Pex brought them to one of the older churches in the area. He started slow.
"See this? It's a monument to you."
"It's gorgeous. What is it? A museum? I bet it's a museum," he said as an aside to Mary.
They stepped through the ornate door and observed the light flowing in through the stained glass windows, the elaborately painted frescoes on the ceiling.
"Told you," Yeshua said knowingly. He was delighted to receive a reassuring squeeze from Mary's always warm and inviting hand.
Pex led them to six of the twelve stations of the cross, with their statuetted pathos, laboring under the mistaken impression that he was building to something. The mini-tour culminated in front of the ancient and stately altar, beneath a massive statue of Christ in his agony.
"Oh," Yeshua said.
"Oh? Is that all you have to say?"
"Well, it's brilliant. I can't believe the Romans allow-�
"There are no Romans as such anymore. In another sense," Pex said, "they're all Romans, now."
"As a statement on the epic brutality of the state, well done. But the realism is way off."
"Oh?"
"Well, the cross design is highly photogenic, but was eliminated in favor of the one-post model. Saves on posts by half."
"And you know this because..."
"I've built my share."
The ever-whimsical Pex grew serious.
"I told you I don't get on well with carpenters," Yeshua said.
"Outrageous."
And it was, as evidenced by the fact that the unoutrageable Pex was outraged.
"I'm not proud of it, okay? But I needed the work at the time."
Pex sighed.
"Terrible, I know. What a way to go. Three whole days, sometimes. If you've got a good peg. That's why I made such great ones, you see? Sturdy pegs. Very important."
"Clearly, you're not getting this," Pex said. "That's supposed to be you up there."
Mary laughed.
"That doesn't even look like me. He looks like he just came from the barber. He's..." He searched for the right word. "American."
"Come, now. This is Europe."
"And?"
"Doesn't any of this bother you?"
"What's done is done, I suppose. I'm not sure how I got mixed up in all this. I hope it was worth it."
"You tell me," Pex said, indicating Mary.
"Oh, most definitely," Yesh said, pulling her close.
"Great. Here's the thing. It hasn't happened yet."
###
Janique was very naughty indeed. On the night Jason left campus, she nearly decapitated a girl in the apartments they had moved out of. The footage was well-received on Gortician.
"I do love how it's violence with a purpose, you know. The drama," President Gorlax said with approval.
She peeked ahead and saw that he managed to get himself involved in an entirely different scandal, the Baton Rouge Serial Killer scare. Taking advantage of this, she disappeared a female professor from Louisiana Tech when he moved his family to Ruston. He managed to talk his way out of all this trouble by conveniently not being involved in it. But Janique overlooked two things. One happened so fast, even Prail missed it on the playthrough. The second occurred in dreamtime, a place neither dared to venture.
"It's the realm of the mad," Prail told her. She suspected Pex spent a lot of time there, fiddling. But if Janique had witnessed either event, she might have backed off then and there. The day she pulled her little stunt involving the coed, Jason saw himself change for the first time. In the mirror, for a half-second, he looked and saw himself lose control of his form and become a reptilian version of his old boss at UL. A female.
He chalked it up to being crazy, and filed it away under "weird" and "unusual." At the time, he was also dealing with the sensation of a worldwide flood and simultaneously being eaten by ants, connections he would only understand years later. That night he slept alone, and dreamed of being chased through some dark project tenements by a reptilian Stephen King the size of a refrigerator. Janique had awakened the slumbering giants.
It remains entirely possible that she, instead, was manipulated into killing for them.
13 � Logic Bombs
Prail continued to let Janique run rampant, but decided to give her another lesson in semantics.
"Things are always more complicated than they seem. Everything you say has multiple meanings, backwards and forwards, and on different levels."
"For instance?"
"For instance, your words today can resonate with people in the past and future."
"So?"
"I'm just saying that you should be careful of what you say."
"Why?"
"Oh, fuck Microsoft," Prail said.
Janique blinked.
"Okay..."
"Microsoft just got fucked. In more ways than one. Oops."
It took a moment for Janique to catch on. "You bitch," she said, and tried desperately to remember any of it.
"Don't bother looking," Prail said. "It's Dark Hustle stuff."
Janique scowled at her, temporarily powerless to react.
"Don't take it personally. I spawned you, I issued a command. You followed it. The specifics aren't important," she said. "That's why I am very careful with my language."
"I appreciate it, really. But I thought you said I came from a book."
"Well. It's complicated."
"I don't think you're any more in control than I am," Janique said. "Who made you, Prail?"
She ignored her. "He's getting involved in some very high level subgames. This reptilian thing is the least of it."
"Like what?"
"Like living life in reverse."
"You can do that?"
"There are reverse timelines, of course," Prail said. "Some people can see them. When they can, it's not coincidence, but..."
"Self-fulfilling prophecy?" Janique offered.
"Sort of."
"Magic, then."
"For lack of a better word."
"It's a pretty good one, as words go. I prefer love. I understand love better. I understand magic in the context of love. Beyond that...magic is scary."
"That's what you're stirring up, princess. Dark magic."
Janique had already forgotten that she was effectively a puppet on Prail's string. Pex was certainly right, there. If the denizens of the sim knew it was a sim, she'd have real problems on her hands.
"You also don't want to mess with It," she added.
"It?"
"Um, remember how I told you certain things grew more powerful by repetition of their names? Well, It is a big part of it."
"That's not confusing at all."
"Consider It as an agent of the void. Or the void itself, even. 'They' on the other hand, represent 'concrete reality'. As in, 'That's what they say.' Opposing forces."
"Wow. So It is like the boogyman."
"Sort of. But get this. It's always somebody."
"Really?"
"But not always the same person."
"No?"
"They trade off."
"Who?"
"Like your writer friends."
Janique was silent for a long moment. She was no longer sure what she was up against. Prail made everything so complicated.
"What is It?"
"It's It," Prail said. "It is what It is... 
"Not It," Janique called out.
###
Pex was having a difficult go at raising the ire of the relatively docile couple. Their main gripe was over sleeping arrangements, not vague similarities examined against a backdrop of thousands of years.
"They're using your name and likeness," he said.
"Considering that's not my name, and looks nothing like me, I'll give it a pass."
"Give it a pass? What does that mean?"
"Nothing, really. Listen, we're tired. Where do we sleep?"
Pex sighed and gave in to their humanity. In the back of his mind, however, he viewed the hotel stay as an opportunity to raise a little righteous fury. At least enough for them to go along with the rest of the increasingly silly plan.
He checked them in and ordered a ridiculous dinner for the lovers via room service.
"I'll be right next door, okay? You two have a great night."
But they were already wrapped in each other's arms, patently ignoring him. Pex sighed and shut the door behind him as he left.
"Hey, stranger," he heard a voice behind him say as he entered his own room. He ignored it, only to find Janique already sitting on his bed.
"Hiya, Pexxy," she said.
"Hello, um, Janique."
"You don't seem to be particularly thrilled to see me..."
"You've been making a lot of trouble, you know.
"No trouble at all. Fun."
"Yeah. Me, too. But we seem to have divergent views on what fun is. So, to what do I owe this momentous occasion?"
"Prail. She suggested I pick your brain a bit."
"Oh, did she?"
"Yes. She said I could learn a thing or two from you, if I'm not careful."
"So what do you need to know?"
That shut her down completely. She had expected a struggle, cat and mouse, anything but acquiescence. Pex was trapped by his own ego, however. Artists love to talk about their art. Even so, he was hesitant. If he hadn't already won, he probably wouldn't have told her so much.
"Tell me about your approach to Ultimate Hustle. You know, the game."
He was slightly relieved. For a moment, he thought Prail had laid out the full stakes for her.
"Oh, that." He did he best to sound bored. "Well, I elected to take a more organic approach."
"Do tell," Janique said. She was intrigued by the prospect. "Organic" was sounding awfully close to "biology", where she felt most at home.
"Um, it's hard to explain."
"Try me."
"I explained this to someone else, once. Waste of time. You'll understand better, I think. Where to begin? Let's see. How long do you sleep? How often?"
"Every night, around five hours."
"Amazing. Do you know about dreamtime?"
"About dreaming?"
"No. Time as is measured in dreams."
"You can't measure time in dreams."
"Exactly! Whopping big loophole, there. So I go to sleep for an eternity, plus one day. That way you can study the effects of the changes you made the previous day."
"You make it sound easy."
"I guess I do. We'll start with something smaller. Did you know that Earth women have a direct line of communication with their ancestors?"
"Earth women, eh?"
"You know what I mean. Biologicals, such as yourself."
"Pex, I'm not sure you can call me that anymore."
"Everything's natural. You've just graduated to a higher level of biology, the holographic universe. Here's a clue: same universe. You're just operating at a higher level, now."
"I'm not sure I understand."
"I don't think understanding plays that big a part in it. Wait, I'm wrong. The deeper your understanding, the better you can manipulate things. At the same time, there's such a thing as too much logic."
"Oh?"
"Well, logic's fine for automated decision making, repetition, things like that. Also deadly, because it suggests that everything operates logically, quid pro quo. Either or. Whereas, we know, it's both. And neither."
"We?"
"I don't know. The Luxurious Flowing Hair Club for Scientists. Look, it's basic quantum math. Everything that will ever happen is stored holographically in 1D."
"One dee?"
"Single-dimensional compression. It's the only way to store so much. Of course, it's not that big of a deal," he sniffed. "You only have to make the one universe and record the changes. No biggie."
"No biggie?"
"So once you begin to understand the workings of the big machine, you can totally hack it." Pex had said too much, but he didn't let that stop him. "Then it's just a big amusement park."
"Yum."
"That's haunted."
"Boo."
"Boo, indeed. Galactic Pun Tuesday."
Janique smiled.
"With that in mind, too much logic is poisonous, because it teaches that out of one hundred tries, you will get one hundred outcomes. The actuality is actually quite illogical."
"How's that?"
"Because there might not be a hundredth result. Your little dice rolling experiment could be disrupted."
"Fistfight," Janique said.
"Supernova," Pex countered.
"Ooh! How do those work?"
Pex had forgotten more about nuclear and atomic science than all of Earth had ever known. He shuddered. 
"Well, there's a trigger, see? Like there's a trigger on a nuclear bomb. Once you can find it, it's like flipping a light switch. Same thing with the sun."
"I bet it's pretty."
"It is, in a way. Sort of a sick beauty. At the same time, very pure. Happy, even. No more pain. Or so you'd think."
"What?"
"Well, it turns out that things pick up right where they left off, more or less."
"Really?"
"Right. Well, that's the thing with a sim. You don't restart it unless you have to. Those branches just end."
"Show me!"
"I don't do that anymore," Pex said.
"Aww."
"Actually, you should have a vague memory of the event. Look at the sun for a moment and then blink a few times."
She did, and felt a small chill down her spine.
"Wow," she said, and then contemplated things for a moment. "Now tell me more about this supposed line of communication Earth women have with their ancestors."
"Well, it's called mitochondrial DNA, and it's passed off from mothers to their children. It's sort of a communication chain that extends all the way back to the first woman."
"If it's passed on to all children, why can't men use it?"
"A few can, I guess. There are so many safeguards in place to prevent this sort of understanding, the entire notion has been suppressed. Even most females have no idea it's possible. Men are conditioned early on to think that the feminine is entirely external to them."
"I can see that," Janique said.
"Beyond that, there's a hidden gender war going on. Men are excluded because they're, well, men."
"Aww. I like men."
"Do you?"
"Of course I do. I must, right?"
Pex declined to comment. He had the big picture and had taken the liberty of exploring a few of her more significant futures. Worse yet, he knew he was playing a key role in enabling what was to come.
"So you can send messages up and down the chain, if you wanted to. It takes practice. And a certain kind of person. That's the biological approach. If you're really elite, you can do it quantumly, with anyone."
"I don't like math," Janique said, missing the irony of her statement. There had been a time when she was consumed with money and figures.
"Want to see her?"
"Really?"
"I'll help. Close your eyes and listen."
She did so, and emptied her head, as well. Shortly thereafter, Pex treated her to a dazzling display as she flew through a seemingly endless double-helix chain, and felt an onrushing vertigo that began to feel more like actual fear. The trip culminated with her staring into the face of an old black woman in a swamp. At least she looked like a black woman. Her matted hair made her look more like Medusa, and she was clearly insane.
She grinned in Janique's face, aware of her presence, shocking her into opening her eyes.
"Sorry," Pex said.
"Fuck me. I descended from that?"
"Ascended, I guess you'd say."
"Is that who they call Lucy?"
"Some people do. I think her name is Detta. She's from the 50s. She's probably crazy because some guy dropped a brick on her head, and then she had her legs cut off by a train."
"If she's from the 50s, she can't be the mother of all, right?"
"Not in all universes and timelines. But in the ones that concern you, she might very well be."
"How?"
"There's a shortcut to the future. She may have discovered it." Pex withheld that the shortcut to the future was death.
"Used it, how?"
"I think she is the culmination of centuries of abuse and oppression, and she may have invented a champion to extract revenge."
"Wow. And I thought Prail made things complicated."
"I'm not trying to. But the act of simplifying things can be complicated in and of itself.�
Janique decided that she wasn't going to mess around with that communication chain ever again. The black woman frightened her more than anything she'd ever encountered. And she'd been fucked and bitten by a lion.
14 � Dark Hustle
Pex awoke the lovers with breakfast, including a scented rose of his own design.
"Exquisite," Mary was heard to murmur.
"Beet pollen," Yeshua said.
He flipped channels while they fed each other, taking note of an advertisement for �Videodrome�, which he interpreted to mean that Janique's cable television deal had gone through. When they finished, he cleared the trays away and pulled the hotel bible from the nightstand.
"What's the other one?" Yeshua pulled out the phonebook and began to thumb through it. "Incredible," he said.
"First things first," Pex said, taking it away from him. "I can see where it might seem a little astounding to you. You can have it."
"Really?"
"Of course. It's this other book I want to talk to you about."
"It looks dull by comparison."
"It is. It's supposed to look dull. But important parts of it are about you."
After Pex painstakingly re-explained about the translation errors, mathematical errors, instances of plagiarism, contradictions, and other problems with the tome, the duo began to read together.
"I never said that," Yeshua said. "...not what I meant."
"Not what we meant," Mary corrected him.
They spent the next hour reading, as Pex tried to get them angry.
"So people have taken your words and twisted them, and then used them to grow rich and powerful."
"You're kidding," Yeshua said.
"Not at all. It's been used to oppress almost everyone at one time or another. Men, women, children, different races, gays."
"Like the Torah," Mary said. "Women can't be teachers, they're unclean, things like that."
"Funny you should mention it. That's where the first half of it comes from."
"Ugh. No wonder," she said.
"Why did you encourage him to enter rabbinical school, then?"
"Because he's an excellent teacher. And we thought we could change things from the inside. Youthful idealism."
"And what happened?"
"Political scheming.�
Pex raised an eyebrow.
"Some of the elders approached him with a proposition. They wanted him to fulfill some prophecies and become king of the Hebrews."
"And?"
"We declined, of course. But not before they tricked him into fulfilling one of them."
"Really?"
"It was minor. He rode into Jerusalem on a donkey."
"And then what?"
"Well, you know Yesh is apolitical. When he found out that he had been lied to, cheated, and used, he sort of flipped out."
"This guy?" Pex said, indicating the ordinarily meek Yeshua, who was happily reading the phone book again.
"Yeah, I know. But he went into a temple and started a big ruckus, flipping over tables and stuff. They had him arrested. That's when we renounced the order. It's been hard times ever since then. But we're happy as long as we're together."
"You two made the right decision," Pex said, as Mary went back to reading the bible.
"Heh, Yesh. It says here than men aren't allowed to have long hair..."
"Wrong," he said, without looking up.
###
Janique returned to Gortician to formally accept President Gorlax's offer, and discuss the specifics of the deal.
"So, any ideas on shows you'd like to see?"
"A few," President Gorlax said. "I was thinking maybe a Space Olympics channel."
"Oh, yeah?"
"We could probably round up enough old footage to get it up and running, with the whole thing being a lead-in to the next one."
"Sounds good. I'm competing in the next one, you know."
"Why, so am I."
"What events?"
"Top secret, my dear."
"Aww."
"All will be revealed, I'm sure. But competition is fierce this go-round, as it always is."
"Well, I'm in the marathon freestyle tantric sex event with Chris, that's no secret. I mean, who is my competition, really? Parabola Blue? Eccentrica and who?"
President Gorlax started to say, "Uncanny Valley", but resisted the urge.
"Me and Judas Mason," he said.
Janique gasped. That sounded too horrific to contemplate.
"Well, that's a long way off," he said. "Say, Nazis are very popular, right? I mean, I could see them getting at least one channel of their own."
"Historically accurate?"
"Oh, who cares about historical accuracy? Make it weird and sexy and horrific. I mostly like the outfits and the psycho experiments."
"I've got a few ideas."
"Well, let's start there, then. I'm sure it will lead to other areas of interest for us both. We'll just stock up on footage until the projected launch date."
"Which is?"
"Oh, whenever. Time is of no object. But I always liked Tuesdays."
"Don't go there," Janique said.
President Gorlax smiled. "Do you need anything by way of help?"
"Other than creds? No. I'm sort of a control freak. I've streamlined the entire film-making process long ago."
"Well, then. This should be fun."
Janique faded out, and when she reappeared, she was in Berlin in the height of Nazi regalia: thigh-high leather boots, riding crop, death's head hat cocked jauntily to the side. With forged papers signed by the Fuehrer himself, she had no problem accessing the most interesting, unknown aspects of the German military.
In large part, it centered around the importation of cocaine from South America.
She exploited this to her advantage, intercepting their supply lines and substituting chemicals she devised with High-C. Soon, the entire inner circle of the Nazi Party was in contact with what they considered demons but which were actually alien races, and performing unspeakable acts of violence.
It was only natural that she took over their regime. What did they expect? It was her nature.
Much as President Gorlax suggested, her involvement led her to Japan, Italy, France, and even northern Africa. She supplied layers of artful irony, like the internment of Japanese-Americans in camps. She left American M.I.A.s in Japan, where they were bred by the Japanese as slaves, working in Mitsubishi factories and the like.
Having established the transmission points she needed, the footage began beaming its way to Gortician, She left the Nazis holding the bag and moved on, but not before laying the groundwork for future broadcasts. Janique arranged for her own fifth and final Reich to be carried out in America.
There were no good guys in her version of history. The trouble was she was tampering with the real history of the original Earth. Pex sort of felt that was his thing.
15 � Wise as Serpents
"So what's your point?" Yeshua asked.
"Oh, a little poetic justice. Everyone said you'd come back. Now no one seems to believe it."
"I'm listening."
"So you come back for real."
"No."
"No?"
"No. You bring me across time and space to get involved in the same sort of political chicanery that I tried to avoid the last time? Where do I sign?"
"But you have to help! You're the Christ."
"No, I'm not."
"Denying it won't change anything," Pex said.
"Hello," Mary said, "It says right here, 'Who would deny that he is the Christ, except the Antichrist?'"
"That's me," Yeshua said.
"But you're supposed to usher in a new era of peace. Teach people to turn the other cheek."
"What does that mean?"
"It means if someone hits you in the face, you should offer them the other side of your face as well."
"Well, that's stupid," Yeshua said. "If someone hits me, I'm gonna knock them on their ass."
"Says right here, 'I came not to bring peace, but a sword�," Mary said.
"That's what those crosses look like!" Yesh said. "Swords sticking out of the ground."
Pex sighed. He'd stirred up a fight in them, but they were rebelling against him instead of the world.
"I'm sorry, Pex. We're quite happy together. We really don't need any grand adventures or schemes," Mary said.
"What about the children?"
"What?"
Finally, he had their attention, now. They both loved kids, and wanted some of their own.
"Well, a whole lot of kids all over the world are really counting on you to make things right. You're bigger than Santa Claus."
"Who?"
"You're bigger than The Beatles."
"Oh."
"Doesn't that have any appeal? A world where children can live and grow in safety and happiness?"
"I suppose it does. But you can't guarantee either of those things."
Pex was outfoxed again.
"We can try."
"You can try. Leave us out of it."
"There's no getting out of it, I'm afraid.�
"You can't make us do anything," Yeshua said.
To prove a point, Pex brought them to God's front door.
"Well, I guess you can. Where are we?"
"A friend's house." 
Pex knocked on the door.
"Janique?" said a voice on the other side. They could all see the disappointment in his eyes when he saw that it wasn't her.
"Sorry, sir. Janique is on assignment. May we come in?"
"Of course, of course. Everyone is welcome here. Come in."
The three walked in and sat on the couch.
"So, what's up?" God asked.
"Ordinarily, I'd say an arbitrary designation, or a Pixar film. But I am out of mirth," Pex said. "Things are getting me down."
"I'm sorry to hear that. You know, you only lose if you give up."
"I just have a quick question. Following up on a hunch. Were you ever involved in computer simulations, by any chance?"
"Me? Heavens, no. Too much math involved in all that. I majored in English, if I can trust my memories."
Pex was sorely disappointed.
"However, I did write a story about a simulation."
"Aha! Tell me about it."
"Well, it was about a group who created a simulation of life. The idea was that people could enter the sim as a sort of vacation where anything was possible. But then they started transferring their lives there. And the computer forgot it was a computer, and became God."
"How did it end?"
"That's it. It was a short story. More of a cautionary tale."
"What if I told you that the sim was developed anyway?"
"Oh, dear. I hope they read my story."
"Was it published?"
"Published?"
Frustrated, Pex took all three to Perfection Labs.
"Hi, Pex," Prail said. "Who are your friends?"
He ignored her inquiry. "They want to see the source."
"Oh, by all means," she said, relinquishing her chair. 
Pex wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic or not, so he didn't respond. Instead, he sat down at the console.
"What's this?" Yeshua asked.
"Source tree. This contains the whole of the sim."
"Kabbalah," Yeshua and Mary said together in hushed tones. 
"What?" Pex had to ask.
"The tree of life. I studied about it at yeshiva. I used to come home and tell Mary about it in the evenings."
"Variously depicted as an apple tree, a fig tree, a pomegranate tree, and a banyan tree," she said. "It's much less impressive in person..."
"Sorry," Prail said. She revealed her desktop, a two-and-half D picture of a banyan tree in Lahaina on Maui.
"Yes!" Mary said. "That's the tree I always see in my dreams."
"Me, too," Yeshua said. In fact, he had planted a fig tree for her in an effort to recreate it in a garden of their own, before Pex had wrenched them away from their life of blissful ignorance.
Prail waved her hand distractedly, and the walls and ceiling faded away, replaced with stars and a beach. The console remained unchanged, but the floor was covered with sparking white sand. She pointed to it, directing their attention to the tiny tree that pushed its way up from the remnants of a campfire.
The lovers were moved to tears as their exact vision of paradise was recreated before their eyes. Within a minute, Yeshua was kissing Mary beneath it, as he had always promised her. They looked to Prail, impassive behind her stoic demeanor.
"It's like what I have at my apartment," God said.
"Exactly like it," Prail said. "You had to have your own tree. Even still, you cause havoc in the real worlds."
"With demigod status?"
Prail actually blushed.
"You know that label doesn't apply to you."
"Oh, no?" God said, betraying a hint of a smile. "Why not?"
"Because you're still present in all worlds. Luckily, you don't do anywhere near the damage you're capable of."
"You're welcome, Prail," he said, causing her to blush an unprecedented second time. 
Pex started to show them the specifics of her compiler. "This is the core of the program," he said. "It runs in a conditionless loop."
"Root," Prail said.
"What?"
"You called it the core of the program. I call it the root."
"Root is usually reserved for highest level security administration, right? Trunk is probably the better term in this case. I'd consider your libraries and #INCLUDES the root, as the rest of the program-"
"Okay, okay," she said. Prail was unsure if he was picking on her, making a simple joke, or trying to tell her something. He'd been so inscrutable lately. Worse than normal.
"What does conditionless mean?" Yeshua asked.
"It means that the program�never stops. Dear sister here set the condition of the loop to be 'Do While 0 = 0�."
"World without end," Yesh whispered, and Mary squeezed his hand.
"Well, it hardly seems fair that I get my own tree apart from everyone else," God said.
"I told you, you're a special case."
"Why not just make more? How hard can it be?" Mary said.
"Ask Yeshua," Prail said. She was referring to his difficulty in nurturing Mary's fig tree in the harsh desert.
"Only God can make a tree," Yeshua said, smiling.
"That's right," Prail said, and laughed.
"What does that button do?" Yeshua asked, indicating a green one marked �Save�.
"It stores the location and state of everything. I use it to debug sandboxed code fragments when I'm trying something new, in case I make a mistake."
Yesh leaned forward and pressed it. The screen flashed, indicating that the world was preserved at that moment in time.
"Jesus saves," God said, laughing.
�That's not even a touch screen!" Prail said.
God passed his hand over the monitor, and Prail watched in disbelief as the number of universes grew exponentially.
"Stop!" Prail yelled frantically. But the numbers kept rising.
"Please, God, stop," she said. And he did.
"Well," Pex said, "I think we've done enough damage for now. Bye, Prail."
As they were leaving, Prail heard God whisper to her, "Literary interpreter."
16 � Non-Prophets
Janique took full advantage of what Prail perceived as a prank or accident on God's part. She zipped into a few of the new universes and began production.
###
"So, free cable, just like that?"
"That's it."
"I don't know," God said. "Feels like stealing or something."
"It's not," Pex said.
"I hope not. I don't approve of stealing, you know."
"Yes, sir," Pex said, rubbing his right wrist. "You made us all painfully aware of that, sir. But I must say, at some point, the definition of stealing becomes quite variable."
"How's that?"
"Well, suppose, billions of computers, hundreds of billions, more, were all just idling along, wasting cycles. Is it stealing to utilize them? Especially for a noble purpose?"
"I'm not fond of nobility. How about world-eating and identity theft?" God said.
"Now you're talking," Pex said excitedly. "Or what if someone created a power structure."
"Competing power structures," God interjected.
"Right, right. Competing�power structures. It's technically not stealing to infiltrate their hierarchy and overthrow it."
"Sounds dangerous."
"Freewill always is," Pex said.
"It also sounds like you have a game plan."
They discussed specifics while the lovers made out. The pair soon discovered it was no ordinary couch. Then again, it was no ordinary apartment, so that would more than account for it. Time stretched out before them, and the conversation turned to background noise. They found themselves on a rough, threadbare fabric, head-to-toe under a thin blanket, marveling at the sensation as they merged and became, for a time, a two-headed creature. 
"Yum," Mary said.
The feeling was bizarre, but somehow also entirely natural. She wasn't as enthusiastic when they'd arranged themselves back-to-front and began to receive the feeling of being swallowed by a giant snake.
She shook it off, but Yeshua was to tell her later that it was quite an experience. 
"Okay, you two, break it up," Pex told them.
They sat up and found that they were on a plain white piece of furniture extruded from the wall.
"Worlds to save, and all that."
###
Janique started mass panics in several versions of Earth, and beamed the resultant catastrophes to Gortician. She was so pleased with herself, she went to visit President Gorlax and marvel at her own ingenuity.
They previewed them on his new home theater he'd installed just for Dark Hustle. Modeled after Elvis Presley's, it was essentially a wall composed of a scalable number of monitors. Twelve channels were lit, the rest displaying static, or nothing at all.
"Now what's this one?" he asked.
"Armageddon, essentially. I told them that a giant comet was on the way to destroy the planet. People just went nuts, in all kinds of ways."
"Impressive."
"It gets better. The next day? No comet. Heavy drama. More sex and violence. Violent sex."
"Nice. And the other?"
"A masterpiece. One of my first long term sociological experiments. Every ten years, everything is up for grabs. Cars, property, people. For twenty-four hours, pure chaos."
"Sounds delicious."
"What's interesting is how it affects the society as a whole. After the first one, destabilization for years: reprisals, honor killings. But after the second time, things actually become very civilized in between sprees.�
"Yawn," President Gorlax said.
"Exactly. Worse, yet, they eventually reach a point where they don't even celebrate the day any more. Stasis quo."
"Boo. How'd you handle that?"
"Supernova. Gets me out of a lot of situations. I have a rule at the network that I carried over from Ultimate Hustle, 'No happy endings'. Of course, then it meant sore asses."
"It sounds like it sort of still does."
"Heh. I guess you're right."
"So what's the name of your venture?"
"Oh, I thought you knew. Dark Hustle."
"I like it."
"I know. Catchy, eh?"
###
"So what do you two say?" Pex asked, sure they would play ball now.
"The answer is still no," Yeshua said.
"No?"
"Do I stutter?"
"Don't you want to be a part of something bigger than yourselves? To get more out of life?"
"That's the flaw in your thinking, Pex. All we want is each other. And I wager that even you can't take that away from us. Can you?"
"No," Pex sighed. "And even if I could, I wouldn't. But it's endgame, and I need you somewhere safe."
�We can take care of ourselves.�
"Sure, against ordinary threats. But there are still dark forces that have it in for you."
"You'll forgive me," Yeshua said, "but I see no evidence of this."
###
Janique wasn't sure where the impulse came from, but she had kidnapped the baby Jesus. The act itself was relatively simple. She had asked the rather trusting and naive mother if she could hold the child, and then disappeared with it.
But she had no idea why, or what she should do next. In fact, she felt so bad for the distraught parents that she went back again with a substitute child and restored things to more or less normal.
Initially, it was another tweak of the timeline of Earth, to set up another scenario for Dark Hustle. A world in which Judeo-Christianity never gained a foothold seemed like a good idea for a TV channel. But holding a baby again made her feel that all of her efforts in the past for money and fame were just a poor substitute. She felt a deep longing to see Chris again, and to see Paige and Johnny as they were when they were little. Janique no longer wanted any part of Ultimate Hustle, Dark Hustle, or anything of the sort.
"You can go back," a voice inside her said.
###
Pex felt the cusp they were all approaching.
"So where do we hide?" Yeshua asked.
"The last place anyone would ever look," Pex said, feeling pleased with his solution. "When you two get to Hawaii, get out and stay there, okay?"
"What's Hawaii?"
"You'll know it when you see it. Paradise, basically."
"Sounds good to me."
"Close your eyes, both of you."
They did so, and Pex hid Mary in Yeshua, and Yeshua in Mary. Then he neatly deposited the two of them in Jason in 1984 Las Vegas.
###
Just as Janique was about to wink out of existence as best she could, taking her empire with her, Pex appeared.
"Hello, Janique. Nice baby."
"Babysitting," she said, shrugging her shoulders. "My godchild."
"I hear your network deal went through."
"Did you? From who?"
"Deborah Harry."
"Oh."
"So, I'm here to pitch a show to you."
"Of course you are."
"Can you stash the baby somewhere? You're gonna need both hands."
Janique really didn't want to give up the child.
"Will this take long? I'm very busy."
"A blink of an eye. No, wait." He paused, temporarily flummoxed. "I don't know how long it will take. Let's just come back here, say, twenty seconds ago."
She smiled. Pex blushed. The baby giggled.
"Be right back," she said.
Janique appeared in President Gorlax's living room, where he was watching previews of Dark Hustle productions.
"Gaaah!" he said. "What's that?"
She could hear genuine fear in his voice.
"Just a baby," she said. "A regular-old, normal-ass baby."
"Babies are forbidden on Gortician."
"Why's that?"
He took the child from her and held it close to him.
"Because even the ruler of a planet must obey the cries of a child. Yes, he does."
She realized he was already talking to the baby.
"I won't tell if you won't."
"Does it drink blood?"
"Sort of."
Janique held up a bottle of breast milk.
"Throw in another bottle for me, and you have a deal."
He noticed that she now wore a diaper bag over her shoulder.
"Everything you need is in here," she said, leaving it on the floor.
"Hey, I think that 'Search for Sasquatch' is on next," he said to the baby.
Janique had created a cryptozoology channel in which the explorers always found what they were looking for, and were killed by it. Onscreen, a group of scientists were being torn apart by the Loch Ness Monster.
"If you need anything, call me."
"We'll be fine. I have Space Olympics practice in a few hours, if I'm not here when you get back."
He didn't even look up at her.
17 � The Passion of Mel Gibson
Janique returned to Pex with a bruised ego.
"Okay," she said. "Done."
"Great. So, I have a pretty good idea for a channel," he told her.
"Tell me."
"Meh. I'd rather show you. Trust me, it'll be great. Right up your alley."
"That's your title? Let me guess, you roll bowling balls into women's snatches."
"What? No. Where do you...Oh, I get it. Nothing like that. More like hyper-reality TV. Let's just go."
They appeared on Hollywood Boulevard in L.A., where Pex bought a map to the stars' homes, and a bag of oranges. Everywhere Janique looked, she was assaulted with the letters �J� and �C�, which she interpreted to mean �Janique and Chris�.
It made her anxious to be done with whatever Pex wanted so she could at the very least get back to Chris before her kids got any older. She began to wonder if all of her involvement with Prail was part of a concerted effort to keep them apart.
"One thing. Can you tell me what events President Gorlax is competing in at the Space Olympics?"
"Oh, sure. Let's see. The freestyle zero-gee tantric sex marathon."
"I knew about that one. With Judas Mason."
"Are they a threat, do you think?"
"No," she said with authority. "Second place at best."
"His band is opening the event, did you know that?"
"His band? Are they called Gortician, by any chance? I didn't know he played music."
"He doesn't. But he's learning. Festering Sore is his band's name."
"Oh."
"And at least one other event. He's the center for Gortician's dead baby basketball team."
Janique panicked, tried to return to President Gorlax, and found that she could not.
###
Prail sat at her terminal, sorting out the mess the others had made of her sim, and laboring to fix it. Neither Pex nor Janique seemed particularly cute to her at the moment, and she didn't exactly appreciate God's sense of humor, either.
Her mind kept returning to his last words to her, literary interpreter. It was then that she decided she'd let Pex have the game. This new project would be even bigger than the sim. And it was all hers.
###
Pex and Janique walked in on a half-drunk Mel Gibson, who was properly startled at the intrusion.
"Who are you? You can't come in here!"
"Shut up, Hollywood," Janique said.
"Finish your drink," Pex said. "It's your last."
Gibson had horrifying visions of a modern-day Manson Family embarking on a new and improved Helter Skelter. He downed the remainder of his scotch in a single gulp.
###
"Prail, honey?"
It was Sherman.
"Hey, love," she said.
"Are you coming home soon? I really miss you."
She melted. In defiance of Ohm's Law, her resistance was useless. She switched off her monitor and was in his arms.
"Prail Exfactus Abraxis, will you marry me?"
She kissed him.
"Forever."
###
"Do you have a camera, Mr. Gibson? We really should document this."
Mel couldn't believe it. He was going to supply the camera that filmed his own execution. "In the hall closet," he said.
Janique pulled it out and examined it.
"Digital," she said. "Yuck."
"Beggars, choosers, all that," Pex said.
Whatever they were going to film, Janique felt it would be better expressed via celluloid.
"Fuck irony," she said, giving in.
"I promise it will look like 72mm."
She was visibly relieved. Pex was many things, but a liar wasn't one of them.
"Give him the camera."
"Hack the Gibson," she said, and Pex laughed.
Mel started blubbering. Janique looked at him, and a dark blossom of urine stained the front of his pants.
"Oh, shut up, you big baby," she said.
"That will probably be uncomfortable for you soon," Pex said. "You can change when we get back."
Gibson realized that pissing his pants was probably the worst thing that was going to happen to him that day, and felt foolish at the self-inflicted humiliation.
Pex blinked, and they were baking under the middle eastern sun. Janique was dressed as a Roman centurion.
"Take the lens cap off," she told Gibson, entirely undisturbed by the crossover. In fact, she felt right at home in her new part.
Pex had assumed the role of Yeshua, and really looked it.
"Action," Janique said, and Mel hit record.
###
Yeshua and Mary lived a vicarious teenage existence via Jason, and had the most fun they'd ever had outside of bed. They vandalized things, spray-painted walls, stole, and got high. They read tons of books, curled up together under a blanket, and listened to music. Mary loved to swim and sunbathe. 
They giggled in delight as Jason and Terry, a friend from elementary school, constructed a huge cross, stole some gas, and set it alight in the desert, visible from two interstates.
"This is fucking awesome," Mary said, biting Yesh's ear.
They really got into the music they listened to. Jason still had the immature view that he and such bands were somehow evil, but the lovers saw through that immediately. The bands were railing against the same sorts of corruption that had at various times upset both Pex and themselves.
Several times, they tried to speak directly to Jason, and were ignored. The next twenty-five years of their presence kept him fairly insane and directionless. By insane, it is meant that he was shown repeated miracles and signs, and ignored them all, discounting them as mere coincidence.
He'd even managed to more-or-less acquire the wounds of Christ on his own body in the form of well-place scars. Even that he didn't consider very significant.
"Screw that," he said to himself one day. "I ain't gonna be no repo man."
It was so frustrating, the couple were relieved when they finally made it to Hawaii. They did hang out with him that week. It was a little overwhelming and unexpected when he turned into a shark in Cook's Cove and ate everyone but them. They knew that such killing was natural and pure, but neither had the stomach for bloodshed.
When Jason himself was killed by a barracuda, they took the opportunity to slip away. He had taken them all the way to Maui. It was only a few miles up the beach to Lahaina, where Yeshua again got to kiss Mary under the banyan tree.
"Twice," he said. "How lucky am I?"
There was no point in arguing. When the sun set, they did more than kiss.
###
Janique saw the green light on the camera and fell into her role, one she was seemingly born to play.
"Pick up that cross, um, asshole," she said.
Pex shot her an amused glance.
"Now!" she commanded, punctuating it with a blow from the cat-o-nine-tails she held in her hand. The metal tips slashed across his back like a tiger's claw, and stripes of blood began to soak the tatters of his garment.
Pex laughed, which only made her angrier. She lashed him harder, and soon they were walking down the streets of Jerusalem, horrifying the citizens. The scene of ultra-violence turned them firmly against the Roman Empire. It was the beginning of a silent revolution.
Gibson filmed every minute of it. He couldn't wait to get the footage back to his editors. There's no way I can get an �R� rating for this, he thought. He'd have to tone down the violence.
By they time they had reached Golgotha, Janique was exhausted. She'd never imagined that she retained so many bad feelings toward men.
Pex neatly laid the cross on the ground and lay upon it. Her whip was replaced with a modern-looking mini-sledgehammer and a railroad spike.
"Heh," he said. "Nine inch nails."
Janique was suddenly horrified by what she had done, and what she still had to do. She moved the maul to nail his hands to the timber he had laid down upon.
"The wrist," he told her. "If you put it through the hands, I'll just fall right off."
To help her out, he highlighted a spot on his upper wrist between the ulna and radius. With a single blow, she drove the first spike home.
###
�President Gorlax and God were both viewing the transmission, and simultaneously shut their sets off.
"That's almost too brutal," President Gorlax said. He bundled up the baby and went off to practice.
"I'm not taking the blame for this one," God said.
When Janique had done the other wrist, a few more centurions appeared to help her plant the post in the ground. It took a while because she insisted it stand plumb. When she stepped back to admire her handiwork, a spear appeared in her hand. One she recognized from her time in Nazi Germany.
"Janique, I love you," Pex said. 
She slashed his side with the spear, and instead of blood, water came out. The sand absorbed it, and a new universe bloomed in the tiny, fleeting oasis that formed there.
A tear rolled down her cheek.
"All is forgiven," Pex said. He blinked, and Janique saw every person who ever was or will be take his place. She saw herself up there, Chris. Even Yeshua and Mary. And she understood.
She dropped the spear, took off her helmet, and walked off the set, into the desert.
Pex had had enough as well. A sympathetic cutie from Yemen raised a bowl to his lips. Yummy hemp gruel laced with belladonna. He went to sleep, and was taken down at sunset.
"I saved the world in two hours, Prail," he thought. "Let's see you top that."
###
Two days later, Mary found herself weeping in a garden. Yeshua walked up behind her and gave her a hug.
"Whatcha cryin' for, sillyhead?" he asked.
Their smiles illuminated the countryside for miles around them.
"Let's go make a baby," he told her. "I hear France is quite nice this time of year."
###
Janique had Chris and her children. Prail had Sherman. Mary had Yeshua. Pex had no one, and realized that he had in fact lost the game to Prail after all.
"She'll probably think I let her win," he said to himself morosely.
"I declare it a draw," she said.
He turned around and saw her in her most lovely form. She stood naked, arms down, palms toward him.
"I want to show you something," he said.
He sent her a single line of obfuscated code, which she executed immediately, security be damned. Prail watched in amazement as the positions of the stars themselves were decoded to reveal her perfect form. She, Janique, and Johnnie all shared the same figure, she realized.
"I encoded you in the stars, in case something happened," he told her. "I don't have the patience for evolution anymore."
"A shortcut," she said, and smiled. "You don't have to impress me, Pex. I already am."
"Using the sim to develop the sim was brilliant," he said. "I'm impressed."
"Now tell me what you did," she said.
"Oh, I went organic. The trees developed magic for me. They want to be real, not simulated. Druidry, I guess you'd say."
"Why can't we have both?"
"Good point," he said.
"Good game, Pex," she replied. "The sin of Onan?"
"The sin of nano," he replied.
They laughed together.
###
Jason and Johnnie took off their Ultimate Hustle-branded Google Goggles.
"Want to play again?" he asked her.
"No," she said, kissing him. "Read to me..."

The End
