1 � Meet Chris and Janique
�He was a hard-headed man / He was brutally handsome� � The Eagles, �Life in the Fast Lane�


�Txt me bk Lv u!�

This was a new development. Chris crouched, pondered it for a moment, and then resumed his walk around the yard. The love of his life had just contacted him, and he was stunned at how she had done it.

They were both in prison.

The text message was a fortune-sized scrap of paper stuck to a small rock. It struck him in the chest from a great distance, with an accuracy that would have impressed Texas sniper Charles Whitman. He had no idea how she had pulled it off, but there was no mistaking her handwriting. If he hadn�t reacted fast and caught it after it hit him, he probably would have never even known that there was a note attached. Moreover, he had absolutely no idea how to replicate her trick. Or even where to send it, for that matter.

They were both facing up to fifteen years for the same stimulant-fueled series of armed robberies and manslaughter, only one of which they were in danger of being convicted of. If they were lucky, they might get off with ten each for good behavior, good behavior being something in short supply in prison.

Ill-fated and star-crossed, their love for each other had blinded them to their fate as it approached like an out-of-control locomotive. What else would one expect of a couple whose theme song was �Life in the Fast Lane�? He wanted to think that their troubles all began when they started committing armed robbery for fun, but he knew it had really started when he kidnapped her.

Chris Turner was a 28-year-old hustler with a hell of a habit. He was addicted to his hostage. He had abducted her shortly after her father had denied her hand in marriage. She had been reluctant to leave on her own, as she was close to her parents and even closer to their money. So, they hatched a kidnapping plot, their first and only. It had proven to be highly erotic, and they were together at last. Thankfully, they had abandoned the idea of extracting a ransom on top of everything else. But they had never cleared the matter up with her parents, so Chris now faced a felony kidnapping charge in addition to the laundry list of crimes the state had on him already.

�She� was Janique Tamerlane Patton, and his only reason for living. 

He slid the note into his pocket and wondered how Janique was fairing in lock-up. She was a smart girl, and tough, but hardly the prison type. Ever since the arrest had gone down, he had worried about her.


###


�She was terminally pretty� � The Eagles


Janique held the girl�s face deep down in the stainless-steel toilet bowl. 

�Drink, bitch, or you�re going to die down there,� she growled into the drowning woman�s left ear.

The girl, however, shook her head slightly side to side. She�d been holding her breath for nearly a minute. Janique and her new roommate were having a disagreement about sleeping arrangements.

In a move that would have made a contortionist proud, she kept the death grip she had on the girl�s afro and the arm she had forced behind her, reared back, and kicked her squarely in the ribs. A large air bubble escaped her mouth, and she began to go limp. But as she did, Janique watched her slap the floor a few times in a sign of submission. She swallowed a few mouthfuls before she was released, but whether she did it intentionally or as a dying gesture, Janique was unsure. She�d gotten her point across just the same. The fact that she had neglected to flush the toilet first only added insult to injury. 

�If we have to fight again, I�m going to kill you. Understand?� she whispered into her cellmate�s ear. �I fuck who I want to fuck. And that�s not you.�

The girl nodded in enthusiastic understanding. 

Janique was confident that Chris was faring better than she was. He was so well-spoken and diplomatic. She was sure he was fine.

###

Chris�s first day had been similarly eventful. His arrival and processing were routine and took until lunch, when he was released into general population without fanfare. He didn�t think it was going to be like this so soon, but he knew he had to make a big showing if he was going to do long time. Luckily, he had a plan, and a few tricks up his sleeve, among other places.

Due to his genetic makeup, a m�lange of Sicilian, Polish, and American Indian, Chris could pass for white, mulatto, or Latino. Or at least he could with a tan. The last few months, however, had left him faded.

He scanned the room once more and then found a somewhat isolated toilet. Within a minute he had a Leatherman Skeletool knife in his hand. He swished it around the bowl and unwrapped the Saran Wrap. Then he strolled up to the middle of the chow line and cut in front of a white guy who was standing behind a black guy.

�Hey, what the fuck?� the white guy protested.

�He let me in,� Chris said, and gestured at the black guy in front of him.

The white inmate tapped the black one on the shoulder, and the confrontation began immediately. Chris made two quick swipes with the razor-sharp blade and began walking away before either was aware they were bleeding.

�That dude cut Mikey!� someone yelled. But he was pointing at the black guy. 

Calamity erupted. In less than thirty seconds, two men were fatally wounded, and a riot was instigated. When he was far enough away from the action, he waded into a cluster of Latinos who were moving toward the epicenter of the disturbance, anxious to see if it involved one of their own.

�What happened, ese?� one straggler asked him.

Chris glanced around one last time. 

�Someone got cut, vato,� he said with a flawless accent.

�No shit?�

At once, he brought the blade low and made a deep slash across the kid�s abdomen. Realization and horror dawned on his face, but no cry escaped his lips. For good measure, Chris snapped the knife closed and shoved it into the slit he had made. Then he found a safe place and waited. Pandemonium was breaking out everywhere. This was no mere riot. It was a becoming a full-blown race war.

Soon the guards flooded the mess hall in full riot gear, firing teargas and rubber bullets, and swinging batons. Chris watched with some amusement as one had his taken away and used against him. As he fell to the floor, several inmates gathered around, intending to stomp him to death. Eventually, the smoke cleared, and things were brought under control. But he wasn�t taken to his new cell. He ended up in the waiting room outside of the warden�s office.
2 � The Robbery
�Eager for action and hot for the game� � The Eagles


While waiting until the raging inmates were subdued, Chris had time to reflect on the circumstances that found them in prison in the first place. He and Janique had been riding around town holding hands as they always did, �Hotel California� in the tape deck, looking for a suitable candidate to rob next.

�I wanna play with a snake,� she said. He moved her hand to his crotch.

�No, a big one!� she said with a twinkle. He knew what play meant in this context. So, they drove around until they found a mid-sized pet store with a sign that read �We Have Pythons�.

In retrospect, they probably should have robbed a chain store. Chris knew there would be trouble as soon as he saw the anchor tattooed on the owner�s forearm. He was old school Navy, a World War II vet. For the last of his kind, he was surprisingly spry. But it was too late. The decision had been made. Masks were on. Guns were drawn.

The old man dropped like lead to the floor behind the counter, and when he came back up, he was fifteen feet away with a sawed-off shotgun. They never saw it coming. They were invincible. It was incontrovertible. Or it had been. Two years of robberies, and no one had pulled a gun on them before.

The buckshot sprayed Chris�s left shoulder and back. A pellet lodged into the fleshy part at the side of his neck. Janique hit the floor as soon as she saw the old man pop up with the thirty aught six. He was too focused on Chris to even notice her disappearance. The shotgun sounded like a cannon to her, fired almost overhead as she crawled along the sales counter. Chris fell to the floor bloody and writhing. It was all she could do not to scream. She gritted her teeth and soldiered on.

In retrospect, she hit the old man too hard. They later learned that he died of a seizure induced by the pistol-whipping. Janique didn�t regret a thing. After all, he had shot Chris. And they didn�t even have loaded weapons. The reasoning was that no matter what, they wouldn�t catch a murder charge. Reason goes right out the window when guns start going off. And it had never occurred to them to simply pay for their new pet. They were too high on each other and robbing for the sexual thrill of it all.

She scooped Chris to his feet, grabbed a snake, and bum-rushed them both out the door. They had dropped their weapons. Their only saving grace was the ancient ammo in the shotgun, which had undoubtedly sat for years waiting for just such an occasion, maybe decades. They made it to the Camaro without further incident. She laid him in the backseat and drove them home with the snake in her lap.

It was a third-floor walkup, and slow going getting him up the stairs. Once inside, she stripped him naked, and then herself for good measure. His body responded immediately, wounded or not. Janique examined the affected areas and touched the small hole in his neck. Then she leaned in and bit him. When she took her mouth away, she had the BB in it, which she spat to the hardwood floor, where it gave a satisfying clicking sound as it bounced and rolled away. She tried to do the same on his back and shoulder, but all she got was a mouthful of blood. She sterilized him and his multitool with vodka and used the pliers to dig out more pellets.

This somehow turned into lovemaking.

When the police came for them, they clumsily broadcast their arrival from blocks away, driving in on screeching tires with sirens blaring.

Chris closed the multitool, something they ordinarily used for what Janique called knife play. He wrapped it in Saran Wrap, which he had planned to encase her in at some point. But they had never gotten around to it. 

He handed it to Janique with a tube of Astroglide.

�Would you do me the honor?� he asked her.

�Why Mr. Turner. I thought you�d never ask,� she said.

�Ordinarily, no. But we might be separated for a while, wife of mine.�

�Perish the thought.�

When the door was finally kicked open, the police found two bloody bodies intertwined with a python, seemingly oblivious to the guns aimed at them. They had to pull them apart.

The couple was allowed to dress, however, and that proved to be most fortunate, as his pants held a little under two thousand dollars cash. Janique retained her g-string through the prison gates.

The snake was taken in as evidence.

###

�She held him up, and he held her for ransom / In the heart of the cold, cold city� � The Eagles


The rest of Janique�s day was a relaxed one. Her two-person cell was adjacent to another, with a small, shared room between them. This in turn opened into the pod, a cluster of thirty-two such cells. The arrangement afforded her a good deal of privacy, although the sounds of the fight couldn�t have gone unheard. But her celly brought her meals to their dining table in silence, so she didn�t have to deal with the outside world at all that day.

Instead, she thought about her wedding.

She had been standing at the mirror in her changing room, getting ready to go out with Chris, applying eye makeup. Mascara specifically, a cheap brand known to run terribly when wet. She was wearing a white ruffled cocktail dress that sort of looked like a wedding gown, which is what had spurred on their elopement, she supposed. He loved her in it and had asked her to wear it that day. One thing she did not wear, however, was a pair of panties.

As she was getting ready, Chris was launching a daring daylight kidnapping. He didn�t take it very seriously, as no actual crime was being committed. Well, perhaps a few small ones. The real crimes came later. He had on work boots, khaki pants, and a wife-beater, and so fit right in with the rest of the landscapers on the Patton estate.

��Donde estan las escaleras?� he asked a passing employee.

�En la edification all�,� he replied, and pointed at a nearby maintenance building.

�Gracias, camarada,� Chris said with genuine sincerity.

He selected a forty-foot extension ladder and carried it on his shoulder to her window. No one paid the least bit of attention as he erected it and began his ascent. At the top, he donned a ski mask in addition to the gloves he had put on before entering the maintenance shed. Chris checked the window. Unlocked. He broke it above the locking mechanism anyway and waited to see if anyone had heard him. When he was satisfied that no one had, he opened it and climbed inside. 

The next thing Janique was aware of was a gloved hand reaching around to cover her mouth. Her heart would have leapt out of it, had it not been sealed tight. She involuntarily tried to scream and of course could not. Her eyes met his in the mirror and she knew it was Chris. Or at least she was reasonably sure. There was something in them that frightened her. 

When his hand came away, there was masking tape over her lips, and a smell that she hoped was ether and not chloroform. It was, and she began to get pleasantly light-headed. Chris pulled out a small length of soft white rope and bound her hands in front of her. He gave no indication of who he was, which excited Janique to no end. Over her head, he placed a black silken hood that she had sewn herself. She had wanted him to just use a pillowcase, which she felt was somehow rougher and nastier, but he wasn�t having it. 

�This hood,� he had said at the time, �is your engagement ring.�

He taped it around her neck as there was no drawstring, and it was very constricting. Not too tight for her, but definitely tight. The average woman would be panicking, in near hysterics at that point. Janique was far from average. When he had finished, he stood back and admired his handiwork as well as her form. He then decided she did need a touch of humiliation after all. Chris roughly pulled down the top of her dress and exposed her perfect white breasts and hard pink nipples.

She could feel his eyes scour her body.

Finally, he threw her over his shoulder and began to walk, oblivious to the fact that her ass and snatch were exposed as well. But she knew, of course. Breezes tickled her as he carried her down the hallway. She was entirely disoriented due to the ether and a lack of sensory input, but she could tell when they were going downstairs. Chris knew his way around the estate she grew up on as well as she did, having spent more than a year sneaking around there avoiding her parents.

When she smelled gas and oil in the garage, she knew they were home free. He laid her in the backseat of her own Bentley, her twenty-first year�s birthday present, and slammed the door shut. She was mildly disappointed that he didn�t put her in the trunk. Almost as an afterthought, he reopened it and spread her legs, exposing her glistening mons venus, bare except for the tiny landing strip above. To her labia majora he applied a single wooden clothespin. The pain was almost too much for her to bear. But the ether, endorphins, and the situation she was in combined to put her in ecstasy.

They drove around for nearly thirty minutes, and she suspected that he was just dragging it out. Finally, he backed the car up to a seedy motel, her requested honeymoon spot. The wedding photos were for their eyes only. The only traditional aspect of their marriage was the fact that he carried her over the threshold. 

The last item removed when he undressed her was the clothespin�
3 � Ultimate Hustle
�He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude / They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude� � The Eagles


Chris was slapped back into reality.

�The warden�s ready for you, asshole,� the guard assigned to escort him said. 

Behind a gray institutional desk sat a pudgy little man with beady eyes. He was a quintessential bureaucrat. Chris knew it at the sight of him.

�Mr. Turner, is it?�

�Yes, sir, warden,� Chris replied smartly. �But you can call me Chris.�

�Thank you, but I prefer a touch of formality. Distance. Now, Mr. Turner, who do you think you are?�

�Sir?�

�This facility prides itself on a low incidence of fatalities. That is due in large part to a lack of racial violence. We embrace all races and colors, here. But since you�ve arrived, I have a dead nigger, a dead spic, and a piece of shit white trash Nazi in critical condition. What does that tell you?�

�I think the Asians are sorely underrepresented,� Chris said.

�Frankly, I should be more upset, but two or three less scumbags on the planet benefits us all. Having said that, if I uncover any evidence of your involvement, even remotely, you�ll die in here. I suggest you keep your nose clean.�

�Sir, I don�t know what went on today, but I can assure you that I am in no way connected to your gang fight,� Chris said.

�You can shitcan your smarmy obsequiousness, Mr. Turner. This ain�t even my third rodeo. I�ve rode this desk for twenty-two years, now. I don�t intend to let you or anyone else threaten my pension. When I leave, this place can burn to the ground for all I care.�

Chris was interested in his attitude. It was something he could use.

�How long do you have left, sir?� The cockiness had left his voice.

�One year. And then I�m free. Until then, I�m as much a prisoner here as you are.�

�Sir, can I assure you that I will be a model prisoner for the duration of your tenure?�

�You could assure me, Mr. Turner, but I don�t place much stock in the word of convicts. And if there is more trouble from you, well, just because there�s no death penalty doesn�t mean you can�t end up in some pauper�s grave. Do you read me?�

�Loud and clear,� Chris said.

###

Janique awoke to a whole new world. When the breakfast call was made, most of the one hundred and twenty-eight members of the pod blearily shuffled out for breakfast. After she brushed her teeth and fixed her unruly hair to a degree, she took her first tentative steps into her strange and frightening new environment. Her apprehension was largely misguided. There was something about nearly killing the biggest bulldyke in the pod that made people look at you differently. Aphasia, the nearly murdered woman in question, was seated at a table with two of her friends, and she waved Janique over, smiling broadly.

When she sat down with her tray, introductions were made. �This Johnny. She cool. She my new daddy.�

Nothing was said about this pronouncement, but it was a significant event that Janique would only later come to understand. Although it certainly could be brutal and hellish, even lethal, women�s prison was entirely different from correctional facilities for men.

The primary difference was the family system women used, as opposed to the gang mentality of their male counterparts. Each four-woman unit became a family, with a mama, a daddy, and a brother and sister, or some variant thereof. The daddy was the token head of the family unit. She made all decisions of significance, was the chief protector, and was given free reign within the family sexually. The mama was the number two, and enjoyed the same freedoms, pending approval of daddy. Mamas and daddies were generally older and more experienced. Janique was neither of those things.

The siblings were usually more interchangeable, and there was a lot of bed-hopping before each woman found her place in this unconventional society. It was only slightly complicated by the fact that there were cell and bunk assignments, although the rollcall system used by the prison to account for each inmate was lax enough to allow everyone to live with the family they chose.

The family, in return, also defended daddy if need be. And things occasionally did turn vicious. Razor fights were probably the worst, and it was always over possessiveness, whether it was objects or people. The tiny blade inside of a disposable shaver was enough to �slap a bitch a buck fiddy�, i.e., cause her to require one hundred and fifty stitches, more or less.

Compared to men�s prison, however, it was a cakewalk.

Introductions were made all around. Mica was a trim, thirtyish black woman with short-cropped hair dyed blonde. She was coolly receptive, and perhaps mildly deferential, but Janique understood that Mica felt her status was undeserved. She did, however, look a bit like Grace Jones, which was a point in her favor. Still, she was someone to keep her eye on. Jill was almost the mirror opposite of Mica. She was overweight, with a beautiful, innocent baby face and breasts the size of cantaloupes. She carried herself with such dignity that you almost never noticed her weight. Janique later learned she was a 32-year-old virgin who had killed her own father in a fit of insanity.

They made light conversation at breakfast, and Janique mostly listened. Then they retired to the dayroom, where she read while the others occupied themselves with the twin distractions of gossip and soap operas. 

###

Chris�s plan began to pay off early, as the warden sent him to solitary for his first night in the pen. He suspected this was for his own protection, but it was entirely possible that it was to avoid further bloodshed.

But at five a.m. he found himself back in general population for breakfast, cell and bunk assignment in hand. Everything he ate seemed to be loaded with salt and he subsequently lost what little appetite he had. He stuck with coffee and milk. The coffee was so watery and tasteless he suspected it was almost all chicory and no caffeine. So, the first business of the day was to get his money right. He scanned the room until he found the guard who processed him into the prison and approached him.

�What do you want?� the guard asked, with a mixture of annoyance and fear in his voice. 

�I need my chit,� Chris said.

�What shit?� asked the rather dim corrections officer.

�Not shit. Chit. The receipt for intake of my valuables at the time of arrest.�

�You didn�t have any valuables. Just shoes and a watch.�

�Well now, you and I both know I came in with one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-five dollars and forty-two cents in cash. I watched you count it, twice. You and some fat guy.�

�Nope, no money. Sorry, convict.�

�Okay. Let me just get your name. A. Hildebrandt. What does the �A� stand for, Hildebrandt?�

�Adam, why?�

�And the fat guy?�

�Donnie Brooks.�

�Okay. So, I�ll need statements from you both attesting that the money I came in with never existed. I�ll have to subpoena the video camera evidence from holding, of course. And then I�ll need a witness statement from a Ms. Janique Patton.�

�And you really think I�m going to do any of this for you?�

�No, not at all. All I needed from you were names. I�ll have an ombudsman or my attorney start proceedings.�

The guard eyed him warily. �I�ll check on it,� he said, walking away.

�You do that, pal.�

Two days later, Chris received a receipt for one thousand eight hundred, eighty-five dollars and forty-two cents. He considered the hundred dollar difference a fee for processing the paperwork.

But on this first day in general population, he needed information about the way things operated in his new accommodations. He was extremely lucky to have Tokio as his cellmate.

Toke was black, nearly sixty, and had traveled the world extensively. He had huge fists and a gentle demeanor, but something hard in his eyes said he�d use them if he had to. He was up on a serious felony rap. Ordinarily, transporting a minor across state lines for the sake of prostitution was the downfall of many a pimp. The young ones were such moneymakers that it was often viewed as an acceptable risk. Tokio was too smart to run a weak game, but instead fell victim to a much more sinister set of charges, production of child pornography. He broke down for Chris what he called ultimate hustle.

 �Prostitution is generally illegal. No matter how careful you are, you�ll get popped eventually. The more money you make, the more likely this becomes. Escort services only work out for the mob, cuz they mob run. Police protected. Now I done pimped all over the world. I learned the game in the service and plied my trade overseas. Servicemen, ya see? Easy money. The hard part was workin� women from different cultures.

�I did a lot in Japan, which is how I got my name, across Europe, a little. Germany was the best �til they legalized it. Legalize prostitution and pimps go out of business.

�Then I hit on ultimate hustle. It was a sure-fire operation, and I thought I had it all sewn up, legally. Because prostitution is illegal, but pornography is not. So, if a motherfucker wanted to get with one of my actresses, five hundred dollars. Because you don�t pay for sex, you pay for the rights to the video and a contract.�

�So, what happened?� Chris asked, unable to hold back any longer.

�Oh, a damn girl was on some Tracy Lords shit. Fake I.D., birth certificate, whole nine yards. And if that ain�t bad enough, she was some Senator�s granddaughter.�

�Fuck.�

�Fa sho�. So, I got hard time, thirty to fifty. We argued mitigatin� circumstances so I got the minimum. But at my age cuz, thirty years is a long time to look at.�

�Thirty years seems like a long time at any age, I expect. Good behavior should make it a ten-to-fifteen-year bid,� Chris said encouragingly. 

�Yeah, if I ain�t killed a motherfucker in here already.�

�Word?�

�With my bare hands, jack.�

Chris considered Tokio�s massive fists. 

�You know what we do to child rapists in here? I�ve done it myself. But in my case, I�m nothing like that, no matter what no fuckin� court says. See, I never ran underage girls. If they�re eighteen, twenty, sure. And then only if I think it�s for them. I don�t gorilla pimp, and I ain�t no sweet mack. This is business. If a girl ain�t the type and you put her to work, she becomes a liability. But a bad-ass bitch is one who would be doing it for free, or works solo. I bring her in, she makes more money, I make money, it�s win-win.�

�I thought pimp game meant you get it all?�

�Thas� a ignorant, old school mentality,� Tokio said. �I love women. To down a female because she�s freaky is just wrong.�

�I feel you,� Chris said. It was essentially his attitude as well.

�The world,� Tokio continued, �is run off hypocrisy and evil. Only I found out too late. When they rolled on me, they found two point eight million dollars.�

�Damn,� Chris said.

�And the motherfuckers seized every last dime. The little bitch that gamed me got probation. For a while I wanted to put a hit on her. But I�m not one to carry a grudge. She was young and dumb, not evil. Still, here I am. I�m only glad they limited their investigation to the United States.�

Chris made a mental note to never fall prey to any similar manipulations if he ever got into such a line of work. It beat robbing banks. Anyone could hire two people to fuck. He wondered how Janique would feel about a new direction.
4 � The Wedding
�They had one thing in common, they were good in bed� � The Eagles


As Tokio hipped Chris to the ins and outs of their situation, Janique was lost in a daydream. She and Chris had been together almost twenty-four hours a day since they had met.

They did try the normal way of life for a while. He worked construction, which paid well, but was somewhat degrading and debilitating. The chief problem was the separation, and the problems it caused. Since his days were divided between Janique and work, they spent a great deal of their free time together making love. This led to many late nights, slipped deadlines, missed opportunities, and mad dashes to work each morning. He didn�t worry her with details regarding his daily commute. Eventually, they elected to seek other avenues of income. Neither liked the dope game, both because of the illegality as well as the unsavory characters it attracted. 

Janique danced in a club for a while, but although she was entirely, scarily committed to Chris, he could never fully relinquish his jealousy. Men and women threw themselves at her with alarming regularity. This resulted in a broken arm for one grabby patron, and a broken jaw for another. Not to mention several arrests for him. 

The men, while problematic, were at least consistent and predictable. The women were entirely random. Many of them only had sex with men for money and established their real relationships with other women. They pursued her relentlessly, and were constantly whispering in her ear, enticing her to leave her man. And while she was often attracted to women, she couldn�t imagine foregoing men entirely, even without him in her life. 

The women that didn�t hound her tried to seduce Chris. This provided him with a constant source of amusement as he pretended to not be aware of their intentions. It was cruel, really. They all wanted him, he was within reach of them, but he would just smile politely and make small talk. He only had eyes for Janique. The only women who had any luck at all approached them both. Even then, it was always only a weekend of fun and games at best, and they were together for quite a while before such escapades were seriously considered.

The first time was when Chris took Janique to be pierced. The idea excited them both immensely and served as a sort of wedding ceremony. The problem was, he knew, it was going to be a highly charged erotic situation. In other words, not something that could go down in the backroom of some random tattoo parlor. Eventually he settled on a former female friend of his who had acquired her skills in the lesbian BDSM community. She wasn�t exactly Janique�s type, but for this particular event, that only added to the build up.

She knew where they were headed and why. But before they arrived, Chris pulled down a secluded lane and walked over to her side of the car. Neither said a word as he had her stand and undressed her fully. He first bound her ankles, and tied her arms together behind her. He left her standing there, trembling, while he looked deep into her eyes. Finally, he kissed her lightly on the forehead. Kissing her on the lips would have made him lose control. Then he put a bright-red ball gag into her waiting mouth.

She swooned and almost fainted. But her eyes began to dart back and forth to the rearview mirror. Her clothespin was clipped there for safekeeping. It was really one of several hundred they owned, but she had to come to think of any wooden clothespin as her own. This one was tighter than usual, and Janique drew in a deep breath through her nose as her sparkling eyes teared up ever so slightly.

A car turned onto the deserted road behind them, and her eyes grew wide. He turned her body to face the oncoming car and held her there for a moment before depositing her on the back seat and covering her head-to-toe with a down comforter. They probably couldn�t see her from that far away, Janique reassured herself. But she wondered if it was true. The heat was stifling. Chris had turned off the air conditioner and rolled up the windows. Soon her entire body was as wet as the spot between her legs.

The remainder of the drive was a short one, thankfully. When she felt him turn into a driveway, her anticipation rekindled anew. He opened the back door and pulled the blanket off of her with the aplomb of a prestidigitator revealing the culmination of a magic trick. When she looked up, her face turned red with embarrassment. It was the figure standing over her that was the source of her consternation. 

Because she knew it was his ex-wife.

He had been married once, and he had described to Janique in great detail both her mental and physical characteristics.  To hear him tell it, they absolutely did not get along. But this sort of intimate arrangement indicated otherwise, didn�t it? She elected to wait and see. It wasn�t like she had any choice in the matter anyway. That was generally the way she liked it. Chris wanted what was best for her, and she trusted his judgment implicitly. 

He lifted her from under her shoulders and dragged her most of the way out of the Camaro. Then the woman, Camilla, put her hands under her knees and together, they brought her inside. They put her on a couch and left the room for what seemed like forever. Janique fought to overcome the jealousy that threatened to erupt inside of her. Ordinarily, such feelings were at best a momentary thing. But these two had a history together. What if he wanted her back?

She put it out of her mind entirely. He loved her, she loved him, and it was the two of them forever. Janique smiled and relaxed her mind and body. Finally, they came back for her. They carried her the same way into a backroom that was, in fact, a dungeon. She was still trying to take it all in when they placed her sitting up on the edge of a gynecologist�s chair. It was hard for her to balance because of her ties, so Camilla held her upper arm to steady her while Chris untied her hands and feet. But the woman gripped her so hard that she found bruises the next day. Whether this was from anger or only normal BDSM attitude, she was unsure.

Chris retied her arms and legs spread wide. He then stood next to her, touching and kissing her as Camilla made her preparations in silence. She swabbed both nipples well with rubbing alcohol and Janique was far beyond excited, her previous reservations now forgotten. They stiffened, her breathing increased, and a tiny trickle of moisture began to escape her. Camilla opened a new needle and ring, and pulled out some wicked-looking hemostats. Janique�s eyes grew wide at the sight, and she began to look a bit like Malcolm McDowell near the end of A Clockwork Orange.

Chris reached down and began to lightly caress her clit, and Camilla attached the stats to one nipple. Again, it was probably tighter than it needed to be, strictly speaking. She nodded to him, indicating it was time. He leaned in and kissed Janique hard on the mouth once more, and then began to whisper in her ear.

�With this ring, I thee wed��

Janique tried her best to repeat her lines through the ball gag. At that moment, Camilla drove the needle smoothly through her left nipple. The sensation of pleasure and pain was so powerful, her back arched off the chair involuntarily and she began to orgasm. By the time she had finished, Chris was whispering, �For better or for worse,� and she had started on her other breast, which brought on another round of convulsions and gyrations. 

When Janique came down, she was in possession of a set of shiny new nipple rings. He leaned in even closer, until his lips were practically in her ear. �Do you love me?� he asked.

�Mm-muh,� she intoned, vigorously shaking her head in the affirmative.

Chris�s eyes then turned to Camilla, who began to speak as if on cue. 

�There�s a certain fee associated with this piercing. Do you agree to pay it in full?� 

Janique looked back at Chris, who imperceptibly nodded. She then shook her head an emphatic yes. At once, Camilla was upon her, licking and fingering her snatch with fervor. All her earlier aggression was gone, and she attacked her with determined gentleness. He cupped and squeezed her breasts as he kissed her, and Camilla extracted her payment.

As they both continued to work her into a frenzy, Camilla reached down with one hand and grabbed another needle and ring combo. Janique was of course otherwise preoccupied. At first, she thought she was being bitten, or perhaps pinched hard. It was a pleasant sensation that grew in intensity. Finally, the needle pierced one labium entirely, and partially penetrated the other. Janique�s eyes rolled back in her head as she emitted a silent scream.

�I now pronounce thee man and wife,� Camilla said, and ran the needle all the way through the other side, as Janique continued to shudder and moan. Her mascara was a mess, but they were tears of joy. Mostly. 

Chris removed her gag.

�You may kiss the bride,� Camilla said. But instead, she herself rose and kissed Janique hard on the mouth, and then allowed her to lick her own juices off of her face. Finally, Chris got down to examine her handiwork as Janique continued to lay there, helpless and immobile.

�Hey!� Chris said. �This wasn�t part of the deal!� 

Instead of a matching pair, Janique bore a single ring through both of her majora, effectively forming a chastity belt.

�Relax,� Camilla said. �You have to give her a week or so anyway, so she can heal. Here,� she said, and handed him the package with the remaining ring in it.

�When she�s all better, and not before, back one side out and put this one in. Make sure you disinfect it first. Very important.�

They began to untie Janique. 

Camilla said, �Remember, �til death do you part. Just like he told me.� She glanced at Chris. �And I ought to kill you both myself,� she added, smiling.

She took her hand and helped her down. Janique�s legs were still shaky, and she hurt all over, but she was happy.

�This was an engagement, not a marriage. You still need to make it legal.�

Janique hugged her tightly, grateful for her understanding and kindness. Camilla ran her hands up and down her body and stole one last kiss.

�Bring her back anytime, Chris,� she said. �She�s a sweetheart. And you�d better hang on to him, Janique. I know I wish I had.�

With that, he carried her out to the car where she rode curled up next to him. Her jealousy gone, she now felt a curious bond, and hoped they would meet again under different circumstances.
5 � They Meet
Chris spent the time between breakfast and lunch on his bunk, relaxing. He knew things were apt to jump off at any given moment, so he took advantage of the lull. Naturally, his thoughts turned to Janique, and the day they first met.

He was between jobs at the time, but he had plenty of money. Too much time on his hands was a problem, though. He pulled into the Dairy Queen and ordered way too much food. This girl sounds sweet, he thought as she took his order. But it wasn�t the fake sweetness many women in the service industry exude. Rather, it was a deep and genuine gentleness that sounded like a foreign melody to his ears.

Seeing her sealed the deal. She was a petite strawberry blonde, probably a size five or six, and her face was exquisite. Chris was very intuitive, and an excellent judge of character. He made his decision in a heartbeat.

�Okay, that�s a triple Hunger Buster, no tomatoes, an order of onion rings, and a large coke, no ice. Would you like to try some cherry pie?� she asked.

�I�d prefer to eat a strawberry pie,� Chris replied, but Janique pretended not to know what he meant. She was intrigued by his directness, nevertheless.

�I�m sorry, sir,� she began, �We only have cherry, chocolate, and cheesecake.�

At the word �sir�, his member stood up and took notice. She was the sexiest thing alive. He had to have her. As Janique delivered his meal through the drive-through window, their hands touched for only the briefest of moments, but that was all he needed. He was ensnared. She was entangled.

�That�ll be three dollars and ninety-six cents,� she said. 

He handed her a twenty and told her to keep the change. The poor girl was probably slaving away for three dollars an hour. What a waste, he thought.

�Can I have your number?� he asked. He hated the pleading sound that crept into his voice.

�I hardly know you, sir,� she said. �Please come again.�

Chris drove off, dumbstruck. Instead of leaving, he impulsively got back in line. He needed to see her again, talk to her, touch her. Smell her, if he could. He placed the same order minus a drink, and Janique knew in an instant it was him. They spoke again. This time, he didn�t ask for her number.

�Did you eat that already?� she asked incredulously. It had been five minutes in line, so it was at least possible.

�Oh, yeah. It was the best meal I�ve ever eaten, easily.�

They chatted until the line forced them both to move on. Five minutes later, he was back at the window. She caught on at that point, and was deeply flattered by the gesture. Chris just continued to make the loop until the backseat was full of meals, enjoying each moment in her company. Eventually, it was almost time for her shift to end.

He pulled through a final time. �Come on,� he said. �Get in.�

�I can�t! I�ll get fired. I have to work because my parents think it builds character.�

�I�ll pay you. They�ll never know the difference.�

Janique hesitated a bit, but then she looked deep into Chris�s eyes. In them, she saw her future. She climbed out of the drive-in window and into his waiting arms. He hugged her until she couldn�t breathe. They had been inseparable ever since. It had been a Monday, May thirty-first to be exact.

To his great surprise, she was a total innocent. Her twenty years had been spent pampered and secluded, sequestered from the lower-class society that was his birthplace. 

The contrast was stunning. She was so sweet and delicate. He was coarse, foul-mouthed, and played rough. She was pale and sensitive. Chris was so dark as to almost appear black or Mexican, at times. Intellectually, they were evenly matched. She was bright and well-rounded, having already obtained her first degree. He was a drop-out, but amazingly well educated on any number of subjects, and she never saw him read nonfiction.

They were as happy as a couple could be. Or so it seemed. The chief problem was that Janique still lived at home, and her parents refused to even meet Chris. They forbid her to see him, in fact. No daughter of theirs would ever be allowed to date a construction worker. Marriage was entirely out of the question. So, they snuck around. She invented fake boyfriends and even brought proper boys home to meet them. 

But she belonged to him.

Quitting her job allowed her to spend most of her time with him, but it wasn�t enough for either of them. When the money began to run low, he had to return to work. So, they tried a different approach, and Chris began to spend his nights in Janique�s room at her parent�s house.

This was risky, but well worth it, they found. He was able to sneak in and out easily enough, but the lovemaking sessions were epic. Moans, groans, screams, yells, laughing, crying, endless dirty talk, and banging headboards all increased their chances of being caught. That was where they both learned the extent of Janique�s submissive nature, and their deep love for each other. 

On one particularly violent and noisy night of lovemaking when they both knew her parents were home and awake, Chris had a flash of inspiration. He removed her panties and stuffed them in her mouth. Her response was both positive and immediate. She began to get so wet, they both knew they were on to something big.

Each night became a new secret adventure, and he plumbed the depths of her love and his lust, as well as the inverse. Chris tried to find her limits only to discover she had none. Occasionally, things grew so intense that he began to feel concerned. Guilty, even. But without fail, when she noticed that he had backed off for a day and tried to simply make love to her, she found ways to reassure him all was right in the world.

It was the most perfect relationship either could ever imagine or hope for. Even though they were only dating, both knew they would spend the rest of their lives together. How could they have known they�d end up in prison, separated, or that federal law prohibited communication between felons?

###

Janique was taking the first steps that would lead her into a world of trouble. She wanted a cigarette. 

She knew she wasn�t supposed to be smoking. Chris had forbidden her many times, but he loved her so much he always forgave her transgressions in this area. The way he explained it, they were radioactive, and he wanted her to live forever with him. Plus, he said, it would age her prematurely.

But he was there, and she was here. If they were together, he would satisfy her cravings in other ways. Since she couldn�t ask for permission, she�d have to ask for forgiveness. She felt he�d understand, given the circumstances. It was prison, for fuck�s sake.

But the fact that it was prison made it extremely difficult to get cigarettes in the first place. All federal facilities such as the one she was in had banned tobacco products. That didn�t mean it didn�t find its way in. On the contrary, its status as verboten made it extremely valuable. A crafty guard could turn a three-dollar pack into a hundred dollars and do that every day. The trouble was, she had no money. There were no male guards on the women�s side. If there were, she�d be sitting on a carton. 

Not that Janique would have sex with a man without Chris�s express permission. He was fanatically jealous. He had let her know in no uncertain terms that if she cheated on him even one time, he would dismember the man in question and disappear from her life forever. Nothing was worth risking that.

Women, however� For whatever reason, Chris didn�t have the same murderous impulses when it came to the fairer sex. He let her know early on that she could have all the girlfriends she wanted, provided they didn�t detract from their time together. Still, the possibility of trading lesbian encounters for a Marlboro seemed remote, and a bit seedier than she ever wanted her life to be. Then again, she never wanted to be in prison, either.

She kept her eyes and ears, not to mention her nose open, and discovered there was tobacco in the pod. Periodically groups of four or five girls would retire to the bathroom, where a hole had been melted in the plexiglass window there. It was their exhaust port. It wasn�t all that effective, because she occasionally smelled it, and it drove her mad. It was probably due to the fact that she had all day to think about it and nothing to use as a substitute. She missed Chris desperately.

Jill broke it down for her. �Tobacco is against the rules here, except for outside trustees. They can buy tobacco and papers from the state, and they have outside lockers in the garage to store it in. Of course, they bring it in anyway.� 

For about two dollars, a trustee could get an ounce of raw tobacco. This was conveniently the size of a small fist. Needless to say, getting it inside wasn�t a major problem for the ladies of the Rachael Corrie Correctional Center for Women.

She brought the subject up with Jill, who warned her away from trying to get cigarettes through those sorts of girls.

�They are hardcore lez, and they don�t like white bitches. If you�ll excuse me,� she said.

But Janique understood. Bitch was the most commonly used word in the pod. It probably had twenty different meanings. Eventually she built up her courage and approached Mica, and asked her about smoking with them.

She sniffed in disdain. �You want us to smoke with you? For what? What do you have to give us? And don�t say your pale, narrow ass, either.� 

�I didn�t know I had to give you anything. I don�t know. I thought we were friends.�

�Ain�t no friends in the pen. Remember that. Tell you what. Give me five orange juices, and you can smoke with us the next time we go. Cool?�

Janique nodded.

About an hour later, she saw the other girls gather up and head to the toilets. No one came and got her, but she followed them anyway. No one acknowledged her, but no one turned her away, either.

They stood in a circle, and a girl to her right lit one. It was pathetically thin, probably one quarter as thick as a real cigarette, and very loose. It burned like a fuse. They passed it around as it dwindled in a matter of seconds.

Mica was to Janique�s left, and she took a long drag off of what little remained. She handed her what amounted to tobacco-colored paper. She took a drag as best she could, and her heart sank. It didn�t satisfy her at all. In fact, it tasted bad. She needed Chris.

The circle broke up and disbanded. As they were leaving, Mica said, �Five juices.�

No friends in the pen, indeed.

###

Meanwhile, Chris was involved in a discussion with Alvin Black, leader of the prison�s Aryan Brotherhood. The irony of his name did not escape him.

Alvin got right to the point. �I saw you cut the nigger. We all think you�re alright with us.�

Chris tried to play this to his advantage. He didn�t see any benefit in telling him otherwise.

�I just tried to do the right thing.� 

�If you ever want to roll with us, say the word. You�d be protected. We run things in here.�

Statistically, Chris knew, they did. The AB made up one percent of prison populations and did something like eighty-five percent of the killings.

He said he appreciated the offer, but couldn�t accept.

�Why?�

�Because I�m Jewish,� he lied.

�No shit?� Alvin asked.

�Yes, indeed. I did the genealogy research myself. My family converted to Baptists after I was born. So, technically I am Jewish. I can�t see throwing in with a bunch of people who want to kill me.�

At this, Alvin launched into an exhaustive lecture on race and Judaism.

�Now, see, that�s an unfortunate misconception. I don�t have a problem with Jews, but Zionism, the belief in Israel uber alles. And the Zionists are just pawns, muscle for the elite. Kinda like the AB is in here.�

Alvin considered this for a moment. He took a deep breath and continued.

�I�m not even that racist. On the outside, I work with blacks, kikes, what have you. On construction sites you might have a Klansman side by side with a black guy all day long. Work is the great equalizer.

�What I do have a problem with is that those motherfuckers are working to pay for welfare and food stamps for a bunch of nonworking leeches, of all colors. In fact, there are more white people on welfare than black. Look it up.�

�Yeah,� Chris said. �I feel ya� on that. But if we eliminated the corporate welfare, and the military-industrial welfare, this country could afford to feed everyone, and provide healthcare, too.�

�Sure. But what are the chances of that happening?�

�None whatsofuckingever,� Chris said, and they both had to laugh.

�Back to my history lesson,� Alvin continued. �Did you know that the Jews were always well regarded in Germany, prior to the first quarter of the twentieth century?�

�No, but I never really considered it.�

�It�s true,� Alvin went on. �Germany was becoming an economic powerhouse, prior to World War One. And they were viewed by the U.S. and England as a threat to global hegemony.

�Another group, Zionists, wanted Palestine as a Jewish homeland. Which is pretty ironic, considering most of the Jews in the modern world are descendants of Eastern European converts and never even had ancestors in the Middle East.

�Anyway, this led to what�s known as the Balfour Declaration in which one group agreed to turn over Palestine, which wasn�t theirs to give, in exchange for ruining Germany�s industrial output. That gave way to the Great Wars, and eventually Israel. A country without a constitution or borders, I should point out. Glossing over the holocaust��

�Hold on,� Chris said. �You can�t gloss over the Holocaust.�

�Right. Well, things are far more complicated than I care to discuss here. I suggest you start with The Crime and Punishment of I.G. Farben and IBM and the Holocaust. They�re not revisionist tomes, just a solid historical perspective on a few of the complexities surrounding this issue. Things are rarely as simple as they�re portrayed in history books.�

�I�ll be sure and pick them up at my local bookstore.�

�Oh, I have them. I�ll be blunt, Chris. We�re killers, you know that. I saw you in action, and I could use you. In return, I can get you pretty much anything but parole.�

�Can I sleep on it?� 

�Of course. Neither of us are going anywhere,� he said with a grin.

###

Later that afternoon, during that post-meal period when Janique most wanted a smoke, she found herself crying on her bunk instead. Her fam was away from the cell, playing games�mostly dominoes and spades, watching TV, and generally making the most of things. But a passing guard heard her sobs and stepped into her cell.

�Hey, are you okay?�

�I miss k-k-Chris,� she lamented. �And I want a cigarette!�

The guard knelt close to Janique�s bunk and stroked her soft, golden-red hair.

�It�ll be alright, sweetie.�

Janique looked up at her. It was a guard she hadn�t encountered before. The woman was a bit taller than she was, but also with red hair. It was darker, possibly out of a bottle, but it was comforting. She wasn�t quite overweight, but somehow both shapely and muscular, with tattoos on both forearms. She was in every way beautiful. 

�Will it?� she asked the guard.

�Yes, angel. It really will. Hang in there.�

The guard stood to go.

�Thank you,� Janique said. �I needed that.�

�Not a problem,� the guard said in response. �Just take care of yourself.�

Janique nodded her head.

�I�m Amy,� the guard said, �Here.� She continued on, tossing Janique a pack with seventeen Marlboro Reds as she started walking away.

�Wait!� Janique yelled. �How can I ever repay you? I could��

Amy stopped her cold. �I�m hetero, sweetie. Married with five kids. Although for you, I�d almost be willing to try.� She smiled and winked.

�Give me your address. My parents are rich.�

The next week Amy received a check for a hundred dollars. She figured she owed her four more packs of smokes for that amount of money.

Janique put the cigarettes in her locker and fondled the solitary Marlboro she kept out. Then she realized she had no way to light it. And there was no way she was going back to the bitches that had snubbed her.

She went to her number two. �Mommy,� she started, �How do you make fire in here?�

Aphasia pondered this for half a second, and then said, �That�s easy. Give me your pencil.�

Janique had received an indigent care package when she entered the pod: paper, stamps, envelopes, a pencil, soap, a razor, and shampoo.

Aphasia pulled a razorblade out of her mouth and Janique tried to pretend that was normal. She started stripping the wood away from the graphite when Janique protested.

�Do you want to smoke or not?� the girl asked, logically enough.

�Okay, sorry.�

When she was done, she handed her three pieces of graphite. �Take these and come on,� she told her.

Janique followed her into the empty bathroom.

�Now stick the short pieces into the socket holes,� Aphasia said.

�Won�t I get shocked?� Janique asked, concerned.

�Only if you touch them both at the same time, silly,� the girl answered.

�Now wrap the middle of the long one with some toilet paper. Loosely.�

When she had done that, the girl told Janique to get her cigarette ready.

�Drop that piece across the other two, and light your smoke,� she told her.

Janique did as instructed, and in an instant, the toilet paper was on fire. She quickly lit her red and inhaled deeply.

�Get your pencil lead,� Aphasia said.

�You don�t want any?� 

�Oh, hell no. They are a tool of the devil, straight up.�

As she was enjoying her first Marlboro, another of the clique girls walked in on her. She was both muscular and taller.

�Bitch, gimme dat.�

Janique never took her eyes off the mirror. She took another drag and set the cigarette down on the edge of the sink.

�If you want it so bad, get it,� she said, looking the girl in the eye via reflection.

She advanced on her and reached out for the smoke. Before she could grasp it, Janique seized her right wrist, twisted her arm, and then broke her elbow with her free hand.

The cry of pain that emanated from the battered female was bloodcurdling, and it brought her cellmate running. When this new girl interrupted them, she saw her friend on the floor, and continued to advance on Janique, who had resumed her cigarette. This one was a little bit shorter than she was. Perfect. As the girl came up behind her, Janique turned and drove the heel of her palm into her nose, which collapsed with a wet crunch. What seemed like a full quart of blood immediately gushed forth.

�You girls want my short?� she asked as she dropped the smoking butt between them.

Amazingly, the girl with the broken arm reached for it, wincing as she finished the leftover cigarette. Janique walked lazily into the dayroom to read a book, having satisfied her craving for the time being.

Naturally, her thoughts turned to Chris. 

She, Chris, and books shared a special relationship. He read to her every night. It was always a title of his choosing, and he always picked out the best stories. She really missed that, now. The only books prison had to offer were bad romance novels, bodice-rippers. But they were all so poorly written and dispassionate that she usually couldn�t bring herself to do much more than peruse the back covers. 
She settled for two of the most promising out of the lot. Pageburner, a trashy detective novel, and another about 1700�s New Orleans that seemed intriguing, both by the same author.

She really wished Chris could write. He tried, for her, but his poetry was pedestrian at best. His short stories lacked a certain imagination. It confounded Janique because he was otherwise learned and intelligent. So, he read to her instead. It was her second favorite thing to do with him.
 
6 � Shaolin
A few years back, Chris was still working construction and Janique was cleaning houses, when he had an idea.
�We�re going to study ninjutsu,� he told her.

�What?�

�Martial Arts.�

He had signed them both up under an authentic Shaolin monk. The idea was that they would become ninjas and rob mansions together. It was more foolishly romantic than criminal, initially. Janique was to select the targets, using her inside knowledge of various estates, and they would both sneak into the homes at night. They agreed to only break in when people were there to give the owners a fighting chance, as well as to raise the excitement level. The first few attempts were so arousing, they made love instead of stealing, forgetting why they were there in the first place. 

Neither was prepared for Shaolin discipline.

They spent each weekend for months exercising, learning, and practicing, for twelve hours each day. It was the only way they could convince the instructor to take them on as students. 

On the first day, her sensei instructed her to kick Chris in the nuts. She was extremely hesitant. But he nodded at her, and stood legs apart, hands behind him. She pulled back, regardless, and kicked him at half-strength. He crumpled and fell to the ground with a groan.

�Excellent! Now, your turn,� the teacher said.

Chris took it exceedingly easy on her, with probably less than a tenth of what he was capable of. Janique barely reacted at all. Her face grew red, and he realized she had enjoyed it. But this was ninjutsu, not speed dating.

�Again,� the sensei commanded. �Harder.�

�Oof,� she said as his foot contacted her delicate nether regions. This time she glared at him. And that is what her senpai wanted. Sensing the change in her, he informed Janique that it was again her turn.

She hit Chris with an amount of force she immediately regretted. He fell to the floor, this time in obvious agony. She rushed to his side.

�Janique,� he said hoarsely.

�Yes?� she asked.

�Still� love you.�

She smiled and then kicked him in the side as she retreated, for scaring her. And that was how they spent the first hour of training each Saturday and Sunday. The sensei considered that aspect of their training complete when neither showed a reaction to his restrained kicks, which were enough to knock out normal individuals. They would spend those nights bruised and sore, kissing each other�s wounds.

One day, there was a female instructor working with the sensei. She was blonde, voluptuous, and deadly. Strong, yet feminine, she set her hair on end immediately. Chris didn�t react at all, which made Janique suspicious. Plus, she would be back on Sunday, teaching the basics of Bushido and Kenjutsu.

The last straw was when, in the context of a conversation, the instructor grabbed Chris�s upper arm and said, �It�s okay, I was raised on a farm.�

She wanted to snap her neck on the spot, and might have, except she wasn�t sure she could beat the woman in a fair fight. After they left for the day Janique cut to the chase.

�Do you want to fuck her?�

�No,� Chris said simply.

�Liar,� she said. �Even I want to fuck her.�

�No, and here�s the difference. If you wanted me to fuck her, I�d want to do so. Other than that, she�s just an obstruction between us. So, I just look through her.�

�Why?�

�Because it�s you and me. Forever.�

She hugged him with all her increased strength.

�Listen to me,� he said. �Have you ever had a well-trained dog?�

�Not really. Just mutts.�

�Well,� he said, �I have. His name was Dummy, and he was as smart as a whip. I could put a piece of hamburger on his nose, and he absolutely would not eat it unless I said, �Get it�. Then he would flip it up into the air, catch it in his mouth, and swallow it.�

�Neat,� Janique said, clearly unsure where Chris was headed with this story.

�Well, one day I had a late night��

�Nice mixed metaphor.�

�Shush. I came home the next afternoon. Dummy hadn�t been fed in nearly two days.�

�That�s terrible!�

�I know. But I wanted to see exactly how loyal he was. So, I rolled up a ball of ground beef and placed it on his nose. I then went and got a drink, went to the bathroom, and returned five minutes later to find the meat still on his nose.�

�Wow!�

�When I finally said, �Get it�, and he did, I gave him the rest of the meat and a beer.�

�I like dogs and beer, too. Hamburger, even. What�s your point?�

�My point is, I�m your Dummy. Unless you ever say �Get it�, in so many words, I never will. And if you never do, that�s fine with me. Because I love you, Janique. I�m complete with you, and no longer need anything else.�

�You�re sweet. You big dummy.�

�I�m not kidding around. I refuse to jeopardize our relationship for anything.�

�I just love you,� she said.

�And I love you.�

�Hamburgers tonight?� she asked, and they both laughed.

The next day, Janique and the blonde sparred after Kendo. She kept losing badly, and Chris could see that her anger and insecurity were beating her, not the trainer. He positioned himself behind her where only she could see him and placed his hand over his heart. She melted. Then she regained her concentration and issued three takedowns in a row.

�Class dismissed,� the blonde said. �You two get out of here.�

Two years into their life of crime, Chris came home to find Janique in bed with an exquisite young lady from India.

�Chris�� she said.

He stood at attention.

�Get it.�

	And he did.

Now, in prison, she fully appreciated what he and the sensei both put her through. Her life now depended on it.

###

Separation anxiety was already driving Chris insane, and it had been less than two weeks since he had been with Janique. He felt like killing someone. He knew exactly who to talk to. When he saw Alvin alone, he approached him and sat down.

�What do you want, Jewboy?� Alvin asked in a parody redneck accent.

�I�m in,� Chris said plainly, then added, �Three conditions.�

�I�m listenin�.�

�I need plausible deniability. You issue the hit, no one else knows.�

�Not a problem. I like the way you think.�

�I don�t want to know anything about them, their names, why they�re getting killed, nothing.�

�Is that number two?�

�No, that�s a subset of clause number one.�

�You really are Jewish, aren�t you?�

�Number two is that I need a quarter gram of black tar heroin every week, rain or shine.�

Alvin whistled. �We�d all love that, Chris. You drive a hard bargain.�

�That�s condition number two, non-negotiable.�

�Hey, Paw, we done got us a jailhouse lawyer in the family,� Alvin started in his redneck accent but then seriously added, �You�re expensive, but worth it, I think. I�ll make it happen.�

�Third, I need a book.�

�And now you sell yourself short. I have tons of books.�

�No, I need a specific title, Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins, ISBN 978-0-553-34897-2.�

�That�s pretty fuckin� specific. You know, anyone on the outside can send you new books in the mail. Don�t you have anyone on the outside?�

Chris looked at him impassively.

�Guess not. Damn. Well, that�s an easy one. Do we have a deal?�

Chris nodded.

�Then lay low and await your deliveries. Two to three days, max.�

The two men shook on it, and Chris wondered if he was in over his head. It�s all for Janique, he rationalized. Anything to be close to her again.
7 � Slingshot
The next time Janique went to smoke, the entire pod waited respectfully outside until long after she was done. Later that day, two girls asked if they could do her hair, and she agreed. All three had a great time, as Janique enjoyed being pampered, and her hair was so fiery red and fine that it was quite a novelty. From that day on, she always had the freshest look in the pod.

Later that same evening, one of the stylists offered to give her a massage on her bunk, and she accepted. It was so relaxing she eventually fell asleep. The girl caressed her back a bit more and then left when she realized she�d get nowhere with her that night.

As Janique slept, she dreamed it was Chris touching her.

###

And so, the fateful day that began this tale is upon us.

Chris�s routine began at five-thirty with breakfast, after which he took advantage of the empty showers and hot water. He had little else to do but lie on his back and scheme, dreaming of an early release. A release that, as we shall see, will not be forthcoming.

Through a none-too-well thought out floating schedule, however, he and Janique found themselves unknowingly outside for recreation at the same time. Martinez, a low-key but well-respected gang member, approached Chris as he stared through the four fences between the two prisons.

�Orale,� he said.

��Como esta usted?� Chris asked.

�Bien, bien,� Martinez replied. �Let me ask you something, vato.�

�Shoot,� Chris said.

�Why don�t you roll with the wipers?�

�The who?� Chris asked, genuinely confused.

�The white power vatos. WP. Wipers.�

�Oh,� Chris said, �I�m a Jew.�

�If you�re a Jew, ese, I�m Chinese.�

�Huh? Why do you say that?�

�Because I�m a Marrano Jew.� 

�A what?� Chris had to ask.

�A Marrano. It means a Jew that adopts another religion, but secretly retains Judaism as their true faith. My father was from Spain and my mother a Polish Jewess.�

�And why are you telling me this?�

�Because I saw you kill Petey, ese.�

Chris opted not to react to this statement at all.

�Petey was the maric�n,� Martinez said. �A rapist. You did me a favor. This time. But you may not get lucky twice. I can have you killed today. Except we Jews take care of each other, s�?� He smiled broadly and slapped Chris on his back.

�I�ve got my eye on you, vato,� Martinez warned as he left.

###

Chris was in the yard. Janique could sense his presence, somehow both magnetic and animalistic. She had prepared for this day, and now that it was here, she found herself lulled into inaction. Snap out of it, she said to herself, Just get ready, and you�ll spot him eventually.

Janique fingered the pocketful of messages she had written and bit her lower lip in worried anticipation. Rec was only supposed to be an hour, and they were invariably shortchanged nearly fifteen minutes every time. She walked to the corner of two walls and faced the men�s side. She had hidden her thong in the only hiding spot she had to get them into prison, and had continued the tradition ever since.

She tried to concentrate on what sort of shot would be most likely to hit her intended target. She began to gauge the relative weight of the various stones and the distance she should stand from the first fence. The wind that day was in her favor. She elected to go with a smaller one first, and focus on the proper trajectory. Because the elastic would be a little less springy each time she used it, Janique felt she had but one real chance to contact Chris.

It was a big yard, and the men�s side bustled with activity: exercise, basketball, haircutting. The women mainly walked and talked in groups of twos or threes. But as she approached the far end of the razor-wire compound, she saw him. Her pulse raced.

He was standing alone at one end of the yard near the fence, arms folded over his chest. She would recognize him anywhere. But he was too close to the fence for a clean shot. She moaned in despair. The bell rang on the men�s side, signaling the end of rec time. Chris stood steadfast as the others turned to go back inside. In a flash that was more instinct than studied action, Janique laid on her back, stretching her panties between her ankles as she had done with him seemingly a thousand times before. She said a silent prayer, kissed the rock, and let it fly.

Her eyes brimmed with tears when she saw him jump as he was struck. A guard came over and led him back to the line by grabbing hold of his upper arm. She had done it!

Mica walked over to find her on the ground, smiling, smelling her own moist panties.

�Girl,� she said, �You�re a mess.�

###

Chris smelled the note he got from Janique. Toothpaste. He peeled it off the rock and re-applied it to the underside of the top bunk. It was all he had, unless you counted the rock.

He had to work on a kite scheme that would let them pass messages between prisons easily and readily. Communication would get them through the long and difficult times ahead. Plus, as far as he knew, she had no money. The reality, in a sense, was much worse. 

Janique�s parents, seeing their opportunity, lavished her with support. She had started receiving the maximum allotment of commissary money, sixty dollars each week, and they vowed the finest lawyers, as well. Had Chris known these things, he may have been a tad less optimistic about the future. He pulled his pillow over his head and tried to sleep.

###

It was only after she got back to the pod that Janique realized why Chris didn�t see her. Her hair was done up in tight cornrows with beads at the end that gave her hair the appearance of a mullet as worn by Bo Derek. In a good way. It was a nice prison look, tough yet feminine. But she would need Patti LaBelle hair the next time she went on the yard.

Amy, the guard who passed her Marlboros, never telling her she was wildly overpaying each time, was making the rounds with a clipboard. Intrigued, and always glad to see her, Janique moved in closer so she could hear.

��in laundry, kitchen, or janitorial staff,� 

�That mean we clean toilets and mop floors? Fuck all that!�

�Mm-huh,� an assenting voice added.

�You�re not expected to work for free, of course. You get seventeen cents an hour on your books, and an additional thirty cents an hour on account upon your release.�

�Ooh-wee,� a girl said. �Forty-seven cents for a job that pays eleven dollars an hour, minimum? Why don�t you lick my ass for forty-seven cents an hour, white girl?�

They all laughed at this. All except Janique.

�Whatchoo make?� one asked.

�S-seventeen,� Amy said, faltering a little. They were starting to get to her. �But it�s a dangerous job, and I worked hard to get here.�

�Dangerous? Us bitches is in here with nuttin�. Fingernails and fists. You got dat radio, homeboys, tasers, spray. Guns. Ain�t dangerous for you, it�s dangerous for us.�

�I�d like to work,� Janique spoke up.

Amy brightened at this. �Great!� she said, a little too cheerily.

The two women drew closer together. �What would you prefer doing?� Amy asked.

�You,� Janique whispered, and they both laughed.

�Cooking, cleaning, or laundry?�

�Laundry,� she said without hesitating.

�That�s an unusual choice. Why there?� Amy inquired.

�Intuition. A feeling. Plus, it�s the hardest job that offers the most exercise. If I cook, I�ll just get fat, and a girl could get in trouble out there leaning on a mop all day.� Her eyes defocused a bit as she thought about this. �Definitely laundry.� 

Amy slowly exhaled.

�Anyone else?�

There were headshakes, eyerolls, and muttered utterances as the group dispersed. Janique was just happy to have some way to occupy her time.

###

Chris never could sleep during the day, other than catnaps with Janique lying beside or on him. Still, he laid in his bunk and eventually someone dropped off a book. It was a new copy of Still Life with Woodpecker, just as he�d requested. Now, finally, he had something to focus on. He set about reading it and making notes. He found the thin sheet of tar heroin pressed between some wax paper inside.

He underlined twenty-seven words on pages seventy-seven and seventy-eight, and numbered them in reverse order. Alvin assured him that delivering it was no problem, and they shipped the page out at the very next shift change. That was easy, Chris thought.

�I need you to kill this fool,� said Mr. Black.

###

The next day Amy brought Janique another pack of cigarettes for the week, and a note. Well, not a note, exactly. It was a page from the first book Chris had ever read to her. At first, she thought it was a coded message, but when she ciphered it out, it was nonsensical. Finally, she wrote it down in reverse, where it made a great deal more sense.

In banyan shadow, Leigh with me
My essential insanity
Make tragic tears
The moon exposed
Deliciously
Flesh amalgamation
But dreams immersed
A desired princess
A romantic invocation

Janique was touched. And angry. His first chance to talk to her and he sends poetry? She supposed it was sweet. Sometimes she needed something a good deal more stern than sweet. But each day she received another page from her book with another poem, maddeningly out of sequence.

###

�Who?� Chris asked. �Which fool?�

�His name�s Omar, piece of cake,� Alvin said.

�Okay,� Chris said. �I like cake.�

�All the same, he�s not a creampuff. He�s a serious soldier.�

�Right. Let�s get our confectionaries straight.�

�He�s being transferred into the unit tomorrow. I want him back out the same day.�

�This isn�t a two-hour dry cleaner. I might need more time.�

�You have all day today and tomorrow. Plenty of time. You�re a beast, Chris. You�ll come up with something.�

He hadn�t expected to get a hit this soon. He hadn�t even crafted any weapons. Chris sat back on his bunk, arms behind his head, and stared at Janique�s note.

Slowly, a plan formed. At lunch and dinner, he hustled milk from more than a dozen inmates, giving them good deals on trades for candy and stamps he had acquired in previous hustles. It was a commodities market in prison, complete with established exchange rates for everything under the sun, but the deal-making made Wall Street look like a playground at recess.

About an hour after dinner was served, he ate a handful of peppermints and downed nearly a gallon of milk. He had heard that no one could drink a whole gallon, and was about to find out. Eight minutes into it, he was feeling queasy. Shortly, Chris erupted into a geyser of pink, foamy vomit. When he was mostly done, he hit the floor, frothing and convulsing. Soon after, he stopped moving. Alvin casually hit the button as a mostly disinterested bystander.

�You got a man down in here,� he said, and walked away.

After nearly ten minutes, medically trained correctional officers were dispatched, and transported a non-responsive Chris to the infirmary. Eventually, he pretended to come to, only to find a solitary, elderly female nurse absentmindedly thumbing through a file cabinet.

�Feeling better?� she asked not looking over at him.

�I can�t focus my eyes,� he said.

�Well, we can�t send you back like that, can we?�

�I�ll be okay soon, I think.�

�Just relax, then. Drink this.� She handed him a disposable cup full of Pepto-Bismol.

He reached for it, then remembered that his right hand was cuffed to the bed.

�It�s not like you�re going anywhere, anyway,� she said, and left.

He refocused his eyes and scanned the room. Not finding what he was after, he slid off and spun around until he could reach the cabinets with his left hand. He began going through the drawers and storage areas, listening all the while for the slithery sound of stockings or padded footsteps. Unable to reach the last set, Chris pulled the bed away from the wall until he could access them.

Finally, he found the orange-tipped object of his desire, and closed the drawer. He spun around in time to get back into position just as he began to hear the nurse�s methodical approach. Both of his hands were empty.

�You still look flushed. Want some Tylenol?�

�No. Aspirin. Thanks.�

She brought him four with a paper cone of water, and he let them dissolve on his tongue before finally washing them down.

�Okay,� he said. �I�m ready.�

He walked back to the pod stiffly, with a new hypodermic needle wedged between the cheeks of his ass.

�You alright, buddy?� the attending C.O. asked. �You�re walking funny.�

�Eh, I got the shits.� 

The guard stepped a bit further away from him as they walked. Back at the pod, he uncuffed Chris and released him without ever bothering to pat him down, so he hid it under his mattress and bedded down for the night.
8 � Circus Aflame
That night, Janique was visited by vivid dreams. In the one she recalled, she and Chris had run away and joined the circus. She was an acrobat, a gymnast working the trapeze, operating without a net. He was at first a circus strongman. She focused her attention on him as he performed a routine involving massive weights. He pulled and strained, but couldn�t budge the dumbbell he was attempting to lift. She called out his name, and as she did, lost her concentration and fell.
She could feel hundreds of eyes upon her as she plunged in slow motion toward the floor.

Suddenly she was standing on a highwire as the crowd cheered her on. She held a flexible pole in both hands to balance, but the platform ahead of her seemed impossibly far away. Unsure of what else to do, she took a tentative step forward. She looked down at her feet, clad in pink ballet slippers, stretched over a taut steel cable.

Somewhere, an elephant trumpeted, and she found herself falling again. Below her was a giant tank, and she tumbled helplessly toward it. But when she hit the water, it instead erupted into a fountain of confetti. She climbed over the side amid gales of laughter. They were now both clowns.

Chris was attempting to walk over to her, but his oversized pants kept falling down, forcing him to keep stopping to pick them up. Janique tried to run toward him only to find that she was held back by elastic. The more she pulled, the tighter the bonds became, until she couldn�t hold her weight forward anymore. Her feet slipped and she was propelled backward like a bullet. She flew twenty or thirty feet in the air, closing her eyes as she struck the ground and rolled. When she opened them again, she was face to face with a huge male lion. It roared loudly at her, all teeth and hot breath.

A whip cracked, driving the beast back. It was Chris, in full ringmaster regalia. A ring of fire ignited, and the lion was directed to jump through it. At once, Janique felt at ease. He was directing the show, and she was safe. 
Then the door on the oversized cage they were in opened. Lions streamed out, attacking the screaming crowd. Chris rushed to her side as the big top erupted in flames�

Abruptly, she was awake, bathed in cold sweat. Janique never put much faith in dream analysis, but she didn�t like this one at all.

###

Chris was already cooking dope in the shower. Unlike many prisons, Ivan Stang Federal Penitentiary had an enlightened design. Dotted around the outside of the pod were individual showers set into the wall between every eighth cell.

Fire was not a problem in the clique he secretly rolled with. He cut a piece of the dry tar with his thumbnail and dropped it into a tinfoil spoon.

Ordinarily, he�d never cook a shot in aluminum, and he would also demand distilled water. Beggars can�t be choosers, he mused. When heated, it dissolved quickly and evenly, consistent with the behavior of good dope. He drew the solution up into the syringe, then gave it a good shake, tapping it with his forefinger for good measure.

He emerged from the shower in good spirits.

###

Janique heaved a sigh as she sat with her knees to her chest on her bunk, staring out into the gloom. Dark, fluffy clouds boiled overhead like great wads of wet lint as the rain rolled down the window like the tears on her cheeks. Eventually, they departed, and her mood brightened as well. She lay back in a puddle of sunshine and languidly dreamt of the day she lost her virginity. 

She had still been pretending to go to work, but was really spending her days with Chris. They rode around holding hands, going out to the movies and dinner, and generally having a lot of fun dating. 

Inevitably, they would end up making out. Parked in the car, while driving, at the park, the movies� Pretty much everywhere they went. The world was a backdrop to their ongoing romance. But after several weeks, perhaps because he was paying Janique a salary, he had still never tried to go beyond second base. The kissing and touching were intense. He would hold her down and drive her wild. She found out she enjoyed being restrained, squeezed tightly, and generally manhandled. She wore each mark he left on her like a badge of honor. 

One afternoon she had had enough. Her body was on fire. While making out on his couch, she moved Chris�s hand between her legs.

He moved it away.

Janique moved it back again.

He again removed his hand.

�Can�t,� he said. �We�re not married��

She stopped and opened her eyes, looking for laughter in his. He was serious.

�Well,� she said, getting up, �If you won�t, I�m sure someone else will.�

A horrified look crossed his face. Now he searched her for signs of playfulness and found none.

�I want to marry you, Janique,� he said.

�You�d better,� she admonished him, and continued to disentangle herself from his embrace.

She stood to go and looked him in the eyes again.

�Wait,� Chris pleaded.

�I�m listening.� 

He said nothing, only placed his hand between her legs.

�That�s what I thought,� she said triumphantly.

�Strip,� Chris said.

She did as she was told.

He stepped back and studied her body for a long while, his eyes taking in the fullness of her for the first time. The longer he stared, the more aroused she became. Finally, he picked her up and carried her to his bed. He laid her down on the covers and again scanned her figure with his eyes. Then he moved her to a new position, each time surveying the landscape of her person intently. Janique got the impression he was photographing her with his mind.

Finally, he laid her on her back, arms by her sides. He stood before her and removed his own clothing. Their eyes locked and then he crawled onto the bed. He pushed her feet back, raising her knees, and began to kiss her. Her toes, her feet, her ankles, her calves. At her knees, he repeated the process on the other leg. 

When he reached the top of her inner thighs he began again, starting with her forehead, her eyes, her ears. He lavished attention on her breasts alone for fifteen minutes. At no point did she rush him. This time when he reached her pelvis, he turned her over and restarted the entire process. When he finished kissing her back, he gave her a thorough massage. So thorough in fact, she began to doze.

She awoke with his tongue in her ass.

Janique, now excited to the point of frustration, began to squirm and moan, pushing herself up to meet his talented mouth. After some time like this, she felt Chris�s finger make its first tentative overtures toward her. She arched her back and pushed hard toward him. His finger disappeared into her, and she emitted a yelp. She settled into the motions that gave her the first of many orgasms that day, but remained ultimately unsatisfied.

Chris turned her back over and slid up to kiss her. She pressed her body into his so hard it was like she was trying to physically merge with him. But when she was again worked into a frenzy, he sat her on the edge of the bed and stood before her. She looked him in the eyes as she went to work, relishing the opportunity to perform for him. Eventually, he pulled her to her knees, where they completed the process. When they had finished that intimate act, Chris laid her back down. This time he didn�t drag things out, but dove between her legs face first, like a starving man at a buffet.

He showered her with kisses, and gradually her flower blossomed, spreading its wings like a pink butterfly. He spent considerable time in her garden of earthly delights. Eventually, he tried to put a single finger inside her, and encountered resistance.

�Relax,� Chris said.

�I am, honey,� she said in a breathy voice. �Do it.�

He looked up. �Do what?� he asked with suspicion.

�Break my cherry,� she said. �That�s what it�s called, right? My hymen?�

Chris stared at her, goggle-eyed in amazement. He raised up on his elbows. �You mean to tell me that we went through half of the deleted chapters of the Kama Sutra and you�re a virgin?�

�What�s wrong with that?� she asked.

�It�s just, I, it�s�� Chris stammered.

�Hot,� she said, finishing his sentence. �If I had told you, you wouldn�t have done all those things to me, would you?� 

�No. Definitely not.�

�Then what�s done is done. I knew you�d be reluctant if you found out. Hell, I had enough trouble as it was.�

Chris moved as if to get up, and Janique grabbed him with her legs. �You�re not going anywhere, mister!�

Gently, she took hold of his head and pulled it down to her. This time, he didn�t dawdle. After a few perfunctory licks, they found themselves face to face.

�You and me?� he asked.

�Forever,� she replied. 

With that, he entered her. She emitted a cry that was fifty-one percent pleasure. Their lovemaking began slowly and tentatively, then built in intensity, quickly reaching tidal wave proportions. It culminated in them both finding release together, with Janique being the more vocal of the two. But their cries of passion had the qualities of a timeless love song, in their minds.

Chris rolled over, sweating.

�You�d better marry me,� he said.

�You know I will,� she said. �We have the rest of our lives.�

Eventually she noticed that his back was scratched and cut so badly that he was bleeding in several places.

�Chris!� she said. �I�m so sorry!�

�Eh. No big deal, silly. You can�t hurt me.�

She looked him in the eyes and said, �Again.�

�Now?� he protested. �But-�

She put her mouth on him.

�Ngh,� was the most he could manage to say.

After that day, they spent what seemed like most of their waking hours pleasuring one another.

�You have to eat, Chris,� Janique would remind him. Or �Go to sleep, you have to get up in four hours.�

At which point he would sleep for three, wake up, and make love to her for another hour. He lost a few jobs before he got it together enough to maintain a somewhat normal life again. They explored his perversions and her submissive nature, with scarcely a misfire to be found in their innumerable sessions together.

They settled into a comfortable yet thrilling lifestyle, despite their forced separation. Janique still had to maintain the pretense that she was working to please her parents. She longed to be with him always, even though she needed to be physically away from him at times, lest she hurt herself, with Chris her obliging co-conspirator.

He was a master of introducing new twists to their encounters. Between that and her natural enthusiasm, it was a match made in heaven. There was nothing Chris could not sexualize, and shopping anywhere with him would give her a feeling of both dread and anticipation. She often tried to discern what he was thinking about when looking at items in the stores, and it embarrassed her somehow, as if everyone around them knew what she was thinking.

They were well-known at various pet shops, checking out the latest toys often. Cages, collars, leashes, muzzles. The managers and clerks never failed to ask how their dog was doing, and neither had the heart to tell them that the apartment didn�t allow pets.

They made incredible messes. Chris was prone to wild abandon, apt to throw objects down and aside, seizing the moment with her, oblivious to the destruction he caused in the process. Afterwards, when she lay exhausted, he would quietly restore the room back to its original state. There were times, Janique mused, when it looked more like a crime scene. And it was that escalating, ratcheting up of daring sexual activity that caused their downfall, she thought.

###

�Blowin� and burnin�, blinded by thirst�- The Eagles


Chris was thinking about drugs, and about how they were definitely their downfall. He couldn�t believe that he�d been so foolish as to allow anything to come between the two of them. 

They had started out drinking together, of course. Smoking cigarettes, back when they were both foolish enough to do that. They eventually smoked some pot together one day and then made love. Chris was hooked. It was such a mind-blowingly sensual encounter with her high, he quickly readopted the lifestyle.

Janique was along for the ride. Truth be told, she didn�t care for the legal implications. But she loved Chris, and they both did enjoy it. He just enjoyed it to excess. That led to the first hitch, when he lost his job over a failed drug test.

�I really thought I drank enough water,� he said, scratching his head.

�Chris, you smoke, like, seven joints a day,� she said. �Give it a rest.�

So, he did. But sometime after that, they dropped acid for the first time. This was a hundred times more stimulating than pot. It was essentially religious ecstasy. They both knew it wasn�t sustainable. It took all weekend and made them both a bit weird if they did it, say, twice in a week. Still, they had an enjoyable experience each time, and grew even closer together.

It was the time they tried MDMA that he almost lost her for good. 

They took it at home, treating it like an LSD trip, with candles, quiet music, and a cozy bed. But on Ecstasy, they couldn�t stay still. At first, they were so hyped up they had to walk. The walk led to the park. The park led to the zoo. Now she was kissing him, cuddling her body against his. 

�I want to go in there,� she whispered into his ear.

Chris couldn�t wait to get her inside.

They went to a secluded wooded section, and he helped her scale the twelve-foot wrought iron fence. On the other side, they both undressed and frolicked among the animals, not making love, but there was a lot of passionate kissing and touching as they both enjoyed this new freedom.

At one point, Chris knew he was peaking. He felt high to the point of being slightly disconnected.

�I have to pee,� he announced, leaving Janique momentarily to look for a place to relieve himself.

In the back of his mind, he was vaguely concerned about her. She weighed a good deal less than he did, and hadn�t spoken in a while. When he returned, she was gone.
9 � The Lion�s Share
Chris panicked. He wandered for nearly half an hour, calling her name and searching frantically. Finally, he decided to go back to where they had been separated and take a more methodical approach. He didn�t think she would go far.
He was right. He found Janique cuddled up next to a male lion, which was sleeping contentedly alongside her. She was squeezing him and pressing her naked body against it, and the lion clearly enjoyed her company. It may have even caught a contact high from her, which would explain the docile behavior. Chris watched in horror as the lion idly licked her face and hairline.

�Kitty-witty,� she said. �That tickles.�

He assessed the situation and decided that yelling and alarming them was a bad idea. He ran back to his pants for his lockpick kit. Janique gave him a hard time for carrying it with him everywhere, but now he was glad that he didn�t listen to her taunts. He was proud of his ability to pick any lock in record time and only carried the set with him to show off his skills every chance he got. 

His haste cost him valuable time though, as it took three attempts to open the relatively simple mechanism on the door the zookeepers used to feed and care for the animals. When he got inside, he panicked again. He might�ve been tripping, but this was definitely the most foolhardy thing he�d ever done.

I must really love her, he thought.

He crouched as he walked, and when he emerged from the enclosure, he was relieved to see that none of the lions had stirred. 

Except for one.

Janique had moved her body forward, and the lion (the huge lion, Chris thought upon seeing it up close) was now licking her between her legs. Chris had forgotten that she was menstruating. He watched helplessly as the lion�s tongue opened her up wide. Her body was racked with a series of shudders, and he knew she�d had one of her silent orgasms.

He crept over to her and took her hand. She clasped it back. Gently, he pulled her arm until she began to move in his direction. Janique rose to her hands and knees. The lion�s mouth followed her almost automatically, and the big cat never opened its eyes. But it too rose to its feet, still sniffing and licking Janique. It crouched somewhat, as if to pounce, and Chris knew it was about to mount her. 

Now or never, he thought. Because, like they say, once you�ve had lion, you don�t go back. He knelt beside her, hoping his scent didn�t upset the big male, or any other member of the pride, and scooped up her naked form. As he stood and began to lift Janique, she embraced him.

�Ssshhh,� he told her. 

The lion strained forward, searching for her, its eyes still closed.

�Chris?� she asked. �Where are we?�

He began to walk faster.

At thirty feet or so from the door, Janique said, �Chris there�s a lion chasing us,� matter of factly. 

He broke into an all-out run. As he turned the knob to exit, it emitted a thunderous roar. He slammed the gate behind him and heard its massive body crash into it.

�Chris,� Janique said, �I�m not sure Ecstasy is right for us,� and went back to sleep.

He brought her home and tucked her into bed.

The next morning, she awoke and said, �I had the craziest dream last night.� 

He never told her differently.

###

 Chris shook his head to clear the memories from his mind. He was a million miles away from his old life, and in prison sentimentality could get you killed in a hurry. He spent the morning on the nod in front of the TV, his head propped up in his hand. He�d sleepily view whatever was onscreen without really comprehending it. Then his eyes would slowly close. Eventually, his head would slip, and he�d wake up for a while. At no time did the small smile of chemical bliss leave his face. 

He began to be regarded as harmless, at best, and extremely vulnerable at the worst. The time he didn�t spend nodding off in front of the idiot box was spent sleeping in his bunk.

Sleeping made the time pass quicker. The most skilled at it could sleep sixteen hours a day without sleep aids. He picked at his meals languidly, without interest. After the evening meal, Chris gathered his clothes, toiletries, and a towel, and then waited.

At eight-thirty that evening, Omar Chapas entered a shower stall. Chris tried to look nonchalant as he approached, but he felt like he had a sign on his back that said �Murderer�. He scanned the pod once again and was relatively confident that no one was paying him any attention. He slipped in behind him as soon as he heard the water turned on, knowing his back would be facing the shower curtain.

He was bigger than Chris, and more muscular, but the element of surprise was a huge advantage in a situation like this. He noted the Old English �La Familia� tattoo across Omar�s upper back and moved in for the kill.

He wasn�t going to make this easy.

His eyes were closed, and Chris simultaneously put one hand over his mouth, and an elbow around his neck. His eyes opened wide as Chris put him in LAPD�s patented stranglehold. He squeezed for all he was worth as Omar both bit his hand and elbowed him in the solar plexus. All it would take was for either man to yell, and it would be all over for Chris. Even if he got out of the shower alive, he�d never survive a week with every knife-loving Mexican in the prison on his ass.

�Duermes,� Chris whispered as Omar continued to struggle. But struggling only used the scant oxygen he had left in his brain faster. He began to go limp.

He held the blood vessels in his neck for a few seconds longer to make sure he didn�t revive too soon, but not so long as to kill him. Then he injected him with a lethal dose of heroin, leaving the needle in his arm.

He never regained consciousness.

Chris peeked through the side of the shower curtain and the coast looked clear.

About an hour later, Omar�s body was found in the still running shower, and the cause of death was correctly listed as accidental overdose.

Later, that evening, Alvin greeted Chris with a smile.

�Chris,� he said, �You�re a motherfucker.�

Chris remained impassive at this. Everything he did was in service of Janique, and his desire to see her again.

###

Janique was insanely horny. She ran one of her cellmates out of their little apartment and hung a sheet over the door, the universal sign that someone was having sex or masturbating. She removed every stitch of clothing, the way Chris liked her. He told her constantly that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and that her body was perfect. She didn�t see it, but nothing pleased her more than to be desired by her man.

She lay on her bunk rubbing her clit and ravaging her ravenous pussy. She began with her pinkie finger and clamped down on it so hard it almost hurt. She pinched her nipples. She fingered herself. She pulled her hair and stuck her fingers down her throat. Nothing came close to recreating the feelings she experienced when Chris did those same things to her.

She reached a somewhat unsatisfactory orgasm thinking about him, and went out into the pod to socialize. What she really wanted was another poem from him, and the mail hadn�t run yet. Janique now had six poems, and six pages of her book.

But she wouldn�t read beyond the poems themselves until she had the complete novel. It was distressing to think that it would take nearly a year to get that book alone. A year without seeing Chris? She felt like she was dying inside. 

She refused to think beyond a year. Only the possibility of seeing him again kept her going. Still, something had to give. A woman has needs, and he had spoiled her previously. She decided to talk to Mica. Janique explained the situation, and Mica went back to her cell for a moment. When she came back, she pulled something out of her pants and passed it to her under the table.

It was smooth, about an inch and a half across, and probably six inches long or so.

�What�s this supposed to be?� Janique asked.

�A dick,� Mica told her pointedly.

�Oh,� Janique said. �So, it�s like a cock, only smaller?�

�Huh?�

�I�m fairly sure it has to be around eight inches long to qualify for cock status. And where�s the head?�

�What?�

�Have you ever been with a man? A real man?�

�Yeah.�

�Then you know this is a poor substitute. How did you make it?�

�Well, you get a rag or something, wrap it in tape. Then just put a rubber glove on it.�

�I can do better. Thanks, but you can keep this little thing.�

The nerve of that girl, she thought. She was genuinely insulted. Not only was she reduced to mere solo masturbation, they expected her to use some parody of a dick to do it with. She sighed. Time for a cigarette, she supposed. Even that simple pleasure was losing its allure. 

She wanted to be under the shade of a banyan tree in Hawaii with Chris, like they had always talked about. Janique was through with talking and dreaming, she wanted to act. Yet here she was. Tomorrow she started work in the laundry, and she also had her first meeting with her lawyer. Maybe those things would distract her a tiny bit.

She doubted that they would, though.

###

Chris spent the remainder of his evening composing. He started on page forty-two, and wrote this poem:

Jiggling princess, feminine heart and soul
Soft sugar and leather
Romantic ecstasy, mating sun and moon
Fallen, connecting in paradise

Not bad, he thought. He was becoming a better poet through discipline, and writing from a predefined list of words stretched his abilities.  Before he went to sleep, he consulted Alvin.

�I have to see her,� he said.

�Who?�

Chris had forgotten that no one even knew about Janique.

�My wife. She�s at Rachael Corrie.�

�That�s a tall order, Chris. I mean, it could happen someday, possibly, if conditions were just right.�

�What conditions?�

�When the stars are aligned, and the moon is in Aries. How the fuck do I know?�

�Then what�s your point?�

�My point is, it�s possible. Stranger things can happen. If it�s that important to you, I�ll keep my ears open.�

�Thanks.�

Chris returned to his bunk and turned the problem over in his head for hours before sleep finally claimed him. If he dreamt, he didn�t remember it the next day.
10 � Dirty Laundry
Janique awoke at her usual time, nine a.m. Everyone else had to get up at five-thirty if they wanted to eat breakfast, but Janique was ghetto rich with food, and she didn�t eat much, anyway. Besides, her celly usually kept a tray for her until she got up. And if not, lunch was at noon anyway. She wished she had something to wear to see her lawyer. As it was, the best she could hope to achieve was a great hairdo and a light application of contraband makeup.
Her first shift in the laundry was from ten to four. At around nine forty-five, she and the few other trustees in the pod gathered at the front door. They talked among themselves while Janique listened politely. Most of the discussions revolved around kitchen work and food.

� �tole that bitch, I ain�t washin� no muhfuckin� pots. You want that shit clean so bad, you wash it, bitch.�

�Girl, that bread puddin� good as fuck.�

�-cut a bitch.�

�We makin� some wine tonight!�

But Janique was the only laundress it seemed, and the knowledge made her feel a little bit lonelier. The guard was some scary looking dyke broad, so she didn�t even have Amy to talk to.

The laundry was the last stop, and Janique was alone with the guard, seeing the scope of the prison for the first time. They stopped at a gate and the guard radioed for it to be opened.

�You know,� she said, �I can do things for you��

�Oh yeah?� Janique said. �How big�s your dick?�

The guard turned red and looked away. 

The laundry was a hot, noisy mess, and Janique loved it. At least she was feeling something. Everywhere she looked, there was activity. Women strained, lifting heavy baskets of towels and sheets, and dumping them into what she learned was the prewash vat. Metal arms then lifted them, where other women fed them into a machine called the Mechanicorp Industrial Wash and Press. But she knew it by another name. Chris had once read to her a novella by Stephen King that described it perfectly. It was called The Mangler. She resolved to steer clear of it if at all possible.

The guard, feelings still hurt, dropped her off in a breakroom, which to her delight was well-stocked with soft drinks. She drank a Dr. Pepper and watched the floor through a pane of glass, trying to get a feel for the work. After nearly thirty minutes of waiting, a stern, squat Latina entered, the laundry foreman.

�Yanique?� she said. �I�m Yenette.�

�Hi,� Janique said.

�I don� put up with no chit,� she said. �If ju don�t want to work, carry jure ass.�

She eyed Janique defiantly.

�Oh, I want to work,� she assured her.

�Good. I want you to start in the repair room. Can ju sew?�

�Yes, I can. Pretty well, in fact.�

�Then come on.�

Janique followed her to a sewing room with industrial sewing machines and sergers. There were piles of prison uniforms everywhere.

�Ju see a hole in something, ju fix it. If eet can�t be fix, ju throw it away. S�okay?�

�Sure,� Janique said. �No problem.�

Jeanette left without another word.

She eyed the mountains of laundry everywhere. She decided to look at the uniforms first. They were standard prison-issue orange jumpsuits, with various rips and cuts in them. She heaved a sigh and grabbed an armload. After figuring out how the industrial sewing machine worked, she put her head down and got to it.

An hour or so after that, Jeanette returned.

�Ju did these?�

Janique nodded.

�Ju do good work. Come back tomorrow, okay?�

Janique nodded again, and Jeanette turned and left. Realizing she had time, and that she had earned it, she removed her own jumpsuit. It was much cooler in her bra and panties anyway. She began to make alterations. She cut the sleeves short and pleated them. Then she sewed elastic in the waist, making the outfit better fit her form, accentuating her curves.

She took the legs in, adding a new seam down the back of them, so they hugged her figure instead of hanging loose. Finally, she put it back on and studied her handiwork in the mirror. She looked fabulous. Now she could face her legal team with confidence.

At quitting time, Jeanette returned once more. Janique had noticed that many of the jumpsuits were large and extra-large and made a remark to that effect.

Jeanette said, �Ees for the men�s preeson.�

A light went off in her head.

�Oh, I see,� she said. �Well, I guess I�ll see you tomorrow, patrona.�

�You speak a Spanish?�

�A little, but I�m learning.�

�Ees good. See you tomorrow, okay?�

Janique lined up at the door with the other girls, but there wasn�t anyone from her pod to talk to. Still, some of them looked and pointed at her, talking behind their hands about her. Apparently, word had gotten around the prison about her penchant for breaking noses and elbows. She faced the corner and removed her makeup from her jail purse. She then applied some pink lipstick and mascara while she waited. She had just finished putting them both back in place when a hand tapped her on the shoulder.

Janique whirled around, ready to attack. When she did, there was a very tall, very stout white girl Janique hadn�t noticed before standing behind her.

�I heard you like to fight,� she said.

�No,� Janique said, �I don�t like to fight. But if I have to, you�re going to the hospital.� 

The girl raised her eyebrow at this.

�I�m a brown belt in karate,� the girl said.

�And I will beat your ass. Got it? Want to try me?� Janique replied.

The girl hesitated for a moment, then turned her back and walked away. When she got back to her friends, Janique could see them laughing at her. She decided to keep an eye on her. Loss of face in jail could sometimes have deadly results, as your word and honor were often the only possessions you brought in with you. Still, she was pleased that she was getting by on reputation alone now. She knew there would be fights in the future, no matter what her rep was. At least she felt ready for her first meeting with the lawyers.

As the guards escorted them back to the pod, one called out her last name.

�Right here,� she said. 

�Your lawyers are here, stay in the corridor.�

The guards brought the other women into the pod and conducted rollcall to make sure everyone had come back. Janique waited patiently, but the entire process only took three minutes or so. The two guards, a mismatched pair that made her think of Laurel and Hardy, walked her in stony silence to the conference rooms. They sullenly indicated room two, and she marveled at the fact that she, the prisoner, seemed happier and more free than the people assigned to guard her. She stepped through the door and was somewhat dismayed to learn that she would be communicating through plexiglass over a phone handset. Oh, well, she thought, felons can�t be choosers.

She sat and waited. After about twenty minutes, an older gentleman, and a woman of about thirty entered the room on the other side of the clear plastic barrier.

They sat down. �Janique Patton?� the woman asked.

She shook her head yes.

�We�ve been hired by your parents to represent you. How are you doing?�

�I�m okay,� Janique said, �considering.�

�Your parents wanted to know. We�re primarily here to discuss our legal strategy.�

�Alright.�

�It is our position that you are entirely innocent.�

�Good.�

�And that you are a kidnapping victim suffering from Patty Hearst Syndrome.�

�What?�

�Basically, a kidnap victim can, over time, identify with their abductors. So, you can be absolved of all responsibility, and we believe we can get you off these charges within weeks.�

�But I�m not a kidnapping victim,� Janique protested.

�Your parents say otherwise. We have at least two witnesses from your parent�s estate who will support the assertion.�

�I�m not sticking Chris with all the blame,� she said.

�Is he the kidnapper?�

�He�s not a fucking kidnapper!� she yelled.

The man whispered into the woman�s ear.

�Your parents have allocated money for therapy for you,� she said. �This syndrome can be difficult to overcome.�

�Are you calling me crazy?� Janique asked, incensed.

�We�re not qualified to make that assertion,� the woman answered noncommittally.

�I�m not going to cooperate with this.�

�You don�t have to. We simply won�t call you as a witness. And if you get irate, that only bolsters our argument.�

Janique was smoldering. She wondered if she could break through the plexiglass.  The other lawyer took the phone.

�Hi, Janique. Bob Thomas. Listen, your parents are paying very good money to ensure that you get a speedy hearing, released from prison, and have the charges dropped. How can you not want that?�

�No one would understand. I�d rather be in here with him than out there without him,� Janique said. 

�I see. We lawyers don�t understand love, but we have read a lot about it.�

It took Janique a moment to realize he was trying to make a joke. She smiled, despite the circumstance, and her beauty radiated like a morning�s first sunbeam. Mr. Thomas tried to return the smile but fell short, through no fault of his own.

�The bottom line, Janique, is that we have a job to do. There is a hefty bonus for the firm if we secure your release. The defense we�ve outlined is the wisest course of action. Although it may seem distasteful, Chris will remain in prison whether you are here or not. And you could do more for him on the outside, could you not?�

She pondered this silently.

�All we ask is that you play ball.�

The last two words struck her like a bat. Chris knew she loved baseball and had vowed to take her to visit not only the major league parks in the U.S., but also a few select baseball fields overseas. She was brimming with sadness and longing. Janique wished the world away, imagining they were the only two people left on Earth.

�No deal,� she said flatly.

The two lawyers looked at each other. Even they knew nothing could stand in the face of true love, fate, and destiny. The woman gathered her papers, and Bob said, �We do hope you�ll reconsider, Janique. Your parents love you very much, you know.�

�I know, and I love them,� she said. �Goodbye��

She went back to her pod smiling, having rejected the only defense that could spring her from jail. She spent the remaining time before lights out sketching designs for the following day at work.

###

It was a quiet day for Chris the next morning. He probably should have been composing poetry for Janique, but he was feeling pensive and reflective. He had been full of regrets since they�d been arrested. Not really over the arrest, which was unavoidable and inevitable. He regretted letting her down in innumerable ways, some so small and seemingly insignificant that she never even noticed. 

He had always tried to pull out her chair, open doors for her, and generally let her know how special she was to him. But the times he failed at that weighed heavily on his conscience. She was so understanding and forgiving, that somehow made it worse. How could he possibly hurt such a creature, even inadvertently?

Then there was the time an old flame of his was in town. Well, not so much an old flame, but there were plenty of sparks, to be sure. Janique was away for the weekend, attending a symphony out of town with her parents.

On Monday, Chris said he had a confession to make. He explained that a friend from school had visited. A girl friend.

�What?�

�We just had a few drinks. It�s not like I slept with her.�

�How do I know that?� she asked.

�I guess you don�t, objectively. But I told you I�d never do that to you.�

�Would you have had her if I didn�t exist?�

�Well, sure.�

�Then as far as I�m concerned, you already fucked her.�

�But��

�But nothing, Chris. You pick up women like breathing, and you love pussy more than food and water. As far as I�m concerned, you can no longer be trusted.�

�I didn�t tell you because it was harmless, and I didn�t want to worry you needlessly. I love you, Janique. It won�t happen again.�

�It can�t. Because if you ever break my heart, I�ll die.�

�Then you, my love, are immortal.�

He kissed her, and she somewhat reluctantly kissed him back and embraced him.

�I just love you,� she said softly into his shoulder.

After that, Chris was careful not to even joke about other women. And it was easy for him, because whether Janique understood it or not, he loved her more than life itself.

But the absolute worst was when they had an actual argument. They disagreed about any number of things: science, religion, politics, situational ethics. But their love mitigated their differences, for the most part.

Janique didn�t probe into areas of his mind that might upset her, and Chris was careful not to be too opinionated where she was concerned. The fact was, either of them would have readily accepted the views of the other, no questions asked. Their love superseded reality itself. But they also respected each other�s differences and knew that the areas in which they did not agree provided the tiny bit of friction all successful relationships must embrace. Otherwise, they wouldn�t be people, but clones of each other.

The argument was over what was �their song�. Chris had said it was Radar Love by Golden Earring.

�Remember that time we were coming back from the movies, and it came on the radio? You held me so tight and we both sang along. It felt magical. That�s our song, Janique.�

�By that logic, our song should be How How How by John Lee Hooker.�

Chris thought about it. It had been a Tuesday. They hadn�t seen each other in over a week, and met at the dentist�s office. They were both going crazy for each other, but were in a room full of parents and children, and could do little more than hold hands and stare longingly into one another�s eyes. Then the Hooker song came on the radio. It was electrifying. They both lost control, kissing each other hard, caressing each other�s bodies. When the song ended, they looked around. The entire room, aside from a few children, was staring at them. They got up, left, and drove straight home.

�Yeah, I like that song,� he said.

�But that�s not our song, Chris,� Janique said.

�Then what is it?� he asked.

�Life in the Fast Lane, by The Eagles.�

�What? I mean it�s a great song, Janique, but I don�t think we�ve even listened to it together before.�

�Nevertheless,� she said.

�I don�t think it qualifies. We would�ve had to listen to it together.�

�There are no rules to this, Chris. If we agree it�s our song, then it�s our song. Q.E.D.�

�I don�t agree,� he said. �On general principle.�

This was the first time to his recollection that they had strongly disagreed about anything. It felt like soul death to him, yet he set his jaw and persisted.

�It would have to be a song we�ve listened to together and had special significance to us.�

�Says you, Chris. What are you, the song police?�

�Janique��

�You�re such a hard-headed man,� she said. At the time, he took that statement at face value. Only later did he realize what she meant by that. Regret. �What about Love is a Rose?�

�Linda Ronstadt? Why not Why Don�t We Get Drunk and Screw?�

�How crude,� Janique said.

�As long as were using songs we never heard together before, might I suggest Elton John�s The Bitch is Back?�

Janique reached for the doorknob. As she walked out, she looked over her shoulder. �Little River Band�s Lonesome Loser,� she said. 

Then she walked out of his life.

It was only then that the totality of what had just happened hit him. Their first fight. And she left him. Still, he was too headstrong to chase after her immediately. More regret. But as he sat alone in his empty apartment, he shuddered with emotion and vowed to never upset her again.

The first thing he did was go and buy The Eagles� Greatest Hits. He listened to it over and over. It really was their song, he discovered. She was so very perceptive. He felt like kicking himself. Worse yet, he had no idea how to get Janique back in his life.

He tried to write for her. She so enjoyed the writings of others. They didn�t ever turn the television on when they were together, but instead she would listen to him read into the small hours of the night. All he ended up with was a wastepaper basket full of balled-up sheets of composition paper. He thought about sending her flowers. She appreciated small surprises like that, and Chris actively worked at giving them to her at random times, even though he wanted to replace them the moment they began wilting. This situation called for more.

He went to the library and then got on the phone. Within an hour or so, he had made all the arrangements. Two days later, Janique received a plane ticket in the mail, with no explanation, for Seattle, Washington.

When she arrived, Chris was waiting at the terminal gate for her. Upon sight of him, her worries were forgotten. She rushed into his arms, and he squeezed her so tightly she couldn�t breathe for a long while. She didn�t care, they were together again. He covered her face and neck with kisses, his tears running down both their faces.

�What, no flowers?� she said finally, and he had to laugh.

He loaded her bags into a cab, and they dropped them off at a La Quinta near the airport. It was the sleaziest La Quinta ever. They both joked about the poor accommodations, but neither cared in the least. The cabbie waited for them, then began to blow his horn, as if he sensed them kissing and hugging each other, on the verge of undressing. But they got back in the taxi and the cabbie drove on wordlessly.

When they had gone several miles, Chris kissed her forehead gently and pulled a black scarf from his pocket. Janique accepted this as a matter of course as he proceeded to blindfold her. She had expected him to take it off at their destination, and the suspense was driving her wild. Instead, he led her by the hand into a large crowd of people, after passing through a gate of some sort.

He never said a word.

Finally, he sat her down in a cushioned chair, kissed her cheek, and left. Her eyes strained to see through the fabric. She listened intently to the people around her, but she couldn�t figure out exactly what the event was.

Meanwhile, Chris was slipping someone a gram of superlab meth and running the best hustle of his life. He returned after about thirty minutes and sat down next to Janique just as the house lights dimmed. A voice she somehow recognized but couldn�t quite place came over the loudspeaker.

�How y�all doin� tonight?�

The crowd erupted in a roar.

�When we wrote this first song, I always thought it was mine. But I met someone tonight who explained that it wasn�t mine. It was for him and his lady. This goes out to Chris and Janique. Together forever.�

The opening riff began to play and Chris leaned over to her. �You�re terminally pretty,� he said, and removed the blindfold.

They were front row, center stage at an Eagles concert, and Don Henley had dedicated their song to them. They both watched, enthralled, with tears in their eyes.

After the show, they didn�t speak, but just enjoyed each other�s company. They walked around downtown Seattle holding hands in a light rain. After a while, Chris said, �I love you, Janique. I�m sorry. That really is our song.�

�Ssshhh,� she said. �They�re all our songs.�

Later that night, Janique asked, �By the way, how did you get him to do that?�

�Threatened his life.�

�Chris!�

�Just kidding.�

They spent the night in bliss.
11 � LY
Chris sent Janique�s poem, but with the irregular mail system, she didn�t get it until the next afternoon. She greeted the day ready to work, with a solid plan of action in her mind. She returned to the repair room and removed her customized outfit. She just worked easier in fewer clothes. Plus, what she was doing made her think intensely about Chris, increasing her body temperature in an already stifling environment.
Jeanette never came and checked on her, and Janique didn�t think she would mind anyway. She selected a Chris-sized uniform with a large tear in the side. Even though it had been washed, she could see the bloodstains and knew what had happened.

She felt a moment of terror, realizing the danger Chris faced on a daily basis. But she pushed these thoughts out of her mind. Janique grabbed a Sharpie and sketched out her design over the slash in the jumpsuit. Then she fired up the serger. It was a lot more work than an embroidery machine, but it got the job done. By the end of the shift, she had a pile of uniforms repaired, each bearing the monogram �LY� in her handwriting.

She knew he would see them, and even wear them, eventually. She only hoped he would recognize her handwriting. The �LY� was of course short for �Love You�, and neither wrote each other so much as a grocery list without including at least that closing. She was pleased at this form of secret communication and complimented herself on her ingenuity.

At first, she was dismayed when Chris�s only attempt at contacting her was a poem. But when she got the second one, she began to understand. To communicate in a straightforward manner would make the entire experience way too real for them. Pining away, day after day, �I love you� I miss you� When we get out�� would quickly get repetitive.

This way was better. It may seem wrong to romanticize prison life, but that�s exactly what they did. Not only that, if Chris had any idea of what she�d been through, she was sure he would try to escape and break her out.

When she got back to the pod that afternoon, Amy had delivered another page from Chris, noting wryly that it was page sixty-nine. Her resolve not to read them had dissipated.

The poem was as follows:

Queen of the redheads
My persistent love
Enveloped in your charms
Close to my imagination
Secret revolution
As we arrange to marry

Janique loved it, of course. He was finally becoming the poet she had always known he could be. Who knew jail was so good for writers? But there was a subtext there, this time. She knew he was limited by the words available on a given page. But his choice, even so, was puzzling. Revolution? Wedding? If her life were a novel, she would consider that foreshadowing. What did he have planned?

That night was movie night in the pod, and this time, somehow, it was a cartoon called �Heavy Metal�. It was cool, and funny, Janique thought, if a somewhat odd choice to show in prison. The women were voluptuous and gorgeous, the men heroic. But the last scenes of the movie are what captured her imagination. A tall, blonde Valkyrie warrior, along with her winged mount, battled an evil overlord. She stood on the brink of defeat, only to rise up and overcome impossible odds. The girl had a birthmark on her neck in the shape of a small red sword. That sword, to Janique, became symbolic of righteousness, of triumph, of strength and independence. She viewed Chris as her noble mount, protecting and supporting her, enabling her to soar to new heights.

Fully inspired, she sought out Lexington, the pod�s resident tattooist. She was an artist who caught a harsh sentence when her boyfriend evaded police during a raid on their apartment. He got away, and she got charged with possession of about five thousand hits of LSD. Mandatory federal minimums meant she was doing a hard dime. But she had a great attitude, and spent her time honing her art skills.

�I need a Tyrakkian birthmark,� Janique told her.

�Is that what kids are calling it, now?� Lexi grinned.

�The sword, from the movie,� Janique said.

�I know, I know. When?�

�Tomorrow.�

�Okay. It�ll be five dollars. You got that kind of long green, white girl?�

Janique laughed. Lexi was so white she glowed, except for her colorful sleeves.

�Yeah, I�m good for it. Go ahead and pick out ten dollars worth of stuff. I want the best you can do.�

�Big baller. Don�t worry, Janique. Sterile needle, solid courage. I�ll go mix the ink tonight. Do you want it the same color?�

�Yes, Pink to red. Not too dark.�

�Gotcha. How�s this?�

Lexi sketched out a quick design.

�Yes! Brilliant. Tomorrow evening, okay?�

�I�ll be here, I�m sure,� she said resignedly.

###

The next day, Chris couldn�t stop thinking of Janique, and wondering how he could see her. He knew he was on good time, since he�d never formally been accused of any violence or illicit behavior, and it kicked in after only two weeks. He put in a request to be made trustee. Competition was stiff on the men�s side. Consequently, all authorizations had to be made by the warden himself.

In the meantime, there was something else he meant to do for Janique, a surprise for when they were finally reunited. He sought out the best Latino calligrapher he could find. In jail, the tattooist was rarely the best artist. Most jailhouse tattoo artists were tracers. He explained what he needed, and the artist, Miguel, traced the approximate size of the tattoo�s boundaries, and went off to work. About an hour later, he returned with an excellent design, and Chris paid him in food.

Then he brought it to Hightower, the reigning tattooist in residence, otherwise known as HT. He laid it down on the table before him.

�I need some ink,� he said.

�Sweet,� Hightower said. �It�s an odd choice for a man in prison, though. When do you want it?�

Chris tossed him a small piece of foil, which he carefully unwrapped.

�Now,� Chris said.

�The customer�s always right,� HT said, eying the chunk of heroin. �But that�s gonna take a lot more ink than I have on hand. How �bout this evening?�

�Fine,� Chris said.

A few hours later, he was summoned to the warden�s office.

�Mr. Turner. I see you�ve managed to go nearly three weeks without killing anyone. And you think you deserve a trustee position?�

Chris said nothing.

�What can you do?�

�Ironhead. Structural welding. Pipefitting. I�ve been lead man, and a foreman. Plumbing. Carpentry, I guess. I can run a crew, and read blueprints and detail sheets.�

�Oh, you can read and do math, eh? That puts you ahead of your peers, anyway. Do you think you can keep from killing anyone?�

�I�ll do my best, sir. I did commit to a year without any incidents, and we have eleven months to go.�

�I think I can use you, Mr. Turner. We have some capital improvement projects in the works. I need someone who can get things done.�

�I�m your man, sir.�

�Good. I�ll send for you in the morning.�

He walked back with the guard in amazement. He couldn�t believe he�d asked for a job and gotten it, just like that. Things were picking up. He got back to the pod, and although he wanted to craft another poem for Janique, he spent the afternoon thinking about the seemingly intractable problem of how to see her. Escape was out of the question, and he didn�t expect to be found innocent.

But making trustee was definitely a step in the right direction.  After lunch and a nap, he looked for HT, and found him in the pod. Chris shook him by the shoulder and woke him up.

�Hey!� he said. 

�Oh, Mr. Turner, how are you?� HT asked, with a sleepy grin on his face.

�I�m a little annoyed. It�s almost time to get my first tattoo, and you�re sleeping it off.�

�Easy, man. I�m ready for you. It�s too big to do in one day, anyway. We�ll do the outlines and start filling it in today, finish it up tomorrow.�

�If you screw this up, expect repercussions.�

�Come on, man. I work better when I�m high. I think you�ll find I have a very steady hand.�

�Everyone says they work better when they�re high. If that were true, most of them wouldn�t be in here.�

�Tell you what. Give me two hours to get straight, and we�ll start. Cool?�

Chris sighed. �I guess it has to be. Thanks.�

Two hours later, HT was alert, drinking instant coffee, and ready to work.

�Chris,� HT said. �I�ve done some faggot-ass tattoos before. If someone can pay me coffee or cigarettes, I�ll tat �em. But your tattoo takes the cake. You must be a hell of man to run around with that on you.�

�Just do the job,� Chris said, ending the discussion.

True to his word, HT�s hand was rock steady. Mellow and focused, he had completed the outline in a little over an hour. Other than an interruption due to bed check, he worked continually between bathroom breaks. By the time he decided to call it a night, he�d filled in all of the top words, and had gone over the bottom outline again, making it darker and thicker.

�I gotta admit, Chris, it�s pretty cool. I�d almost leave it the way is. It adds emphasis and is interesting to look at. It�s kinda like� unfinished business, in a way.�

�I�ll think about it,� Chris said. �But if not, same time tomorrow?�

�Oh, sure.�

�Peace.�

Chris went to the bathroom and adjusted his boxers. The placement of the tattoo was excellent. Above his waistband sat the words �All Yours�, and below it, �Forever�.

He couldn�t wait to show it to Janique. 
12 � The Replica
Janique fairly bounded from her bed the next morning, infused with purpose. She had a full day�s agenda planned. She drank her coffee, and then smoked a cigarette without much enthusiasm. She seemed to be losing her taste for it. Her real addiction was Chris, and nicotine was a poor substitute for him. For one thing, the cigarettes felt far too tiny in her mouth.
She got a piece of paper and traced an outline of her hand onto it. She visualized what she needed to see, and then folded it up and placed it in her breast pocket.

Lexi sauntered over, coffee in hand.

�Girl, you gonna be ready tonight?�

�Sure, why not?�

�Well, it�s your first tattoo, and in a sensitive area, too. The neck, collarbone, spine, places like those hurt a lot more than your arm or something. Um, the pelvis really hurts.�

�I�ll be fine. A certain amount of pain is to be expected in life. I find it makes the pleasurable that much more worthwhile.�

�Okay, because it�s not like those piercings. They�re over in seconds. I�ll be on your neck for a good fifteen minutes. And the second pass will hurt even more.�

The thought appealed to Janique.

�Do your worst,� she said, smiling.

�I will,� Lexi said. �Have a good day at work, dear.� She kissed Janique on the forehead. 

�Thanks. You, too.�

For some reason, there was a delay in bringing the trustees in that morning, and when they finally arrived at the laundry, Janique understood why. Ordinarily, the room was a hive of activity, but today the machines stood silent and unattended.

Jeanette addressed the gathered crowd of curious laundry workers.

�I jus� wanted to inform ju all of wha�s coming up. But first I wanted to thank ju all on the great job ju all do every day.

�Laundry is the hottest, hardest job there is. We do the most work, and get the fewest benefits. Ju girls have the best attendance and safety record in the facility. I just wanted to recognize ju all for that. Thank ju.

�Now, the facility,� (Jeanette rarely used the word prison), �has been granted five million dollars for capital improvements.

�That means we�re expanding the laundry and kitchen areas, among other things. For us, it will mean newer equipment, and better air conditioning. We�ll also be getting our own lunch area, with a salad bar. So be proud, ladies. You earned it.�

A brief cheer erupted from the assembly.

�Having said that, the transition will be difficult. We�re expected to change and grow, but still put out the same amount of work we always have. Additionally, there will be construction workers and male guards present from time to time. Some of their work will be done at night, but a certain amount of overlap is inevitable.

�Ladies, I know some of ju still like men��

A small contingent of women booed this statement.

�But I must inform you that fraternization will be treated the same as weapon possession. Zero tolerance. If jure caught talking to a guard or worker, jule never be allowed to work in the laundry again.�

Jeanette went on to explain the new emergency and fire escape plans, and to list some of the new safety hazards that would be present.

�Don�t look at welding arcs, and don�t inhale the smoke. If there are sparks, stay far away, at least twenty feet. There should be barricades, but either way, protect jureself. Again, thank you, ladies. Now get to work.�

The crowd grumbled slightly and began to shuffle off to their stations. Janique noted that Jeanette had lost most of her accent as she spoke to her employees.

Before going to the repair center, she found a roll of electrical tape, and grabbed a latex glove that the girls wore when dealing with bleach and detergent. Once she was at her workbench, Janique stripped, as she now always did, and did a few monogrammed repairs so she�d have something to show in case Jeanette happened to check in on her. Then she unfolded her sheet of paper and began to sketch a different shape on top of the outline of her hand. She moved as if she were a person in a dream, and had the uncanny feeling that she was. She cut strips of fabric from discarded uniforms and began to twist them together and wrap them with tape. When she had finished, she tied the latex glove over her creation.

She held it in her hand and hefted it, considering its weight. Janique had fashioned nearly a perfect replica of Chris�s cock from memory. From the tip of the oversized head to the base and balls, nearly every detail was there. Having finished early, she considered adding vein details, but decided that wasn�t really necessary.

Besides, she wanted to try it out.

For this, she put her jumpsuit back on. There was an undershirt to wear with it, but she liked the way it rubbed her nipples raw through the course of the day. She put it in her mouth and slipped her hand into her panties, glancing back at the door as she did so. Her back was to the entrance, so she would be able to hear someone coming and have a few seconds before they passed the ceiling-high racks of prison uniforms. She envisioned a new outfit and vowed to wear it to court.

She wet her fingers and applied the tiny bit of moisture her swollen pussylips required for admission. Janique rubbed it up and down on herself as she cupped one breast and brought it up to her hungry mouth. Unable to contain herself, she began to push it inside her, biting her lip through the inevitable pain. She was a born-again virgin. Even still, she found herself unable or unwilling to take it all, at least on the first go. She lost herself in fantasy as she manipulated herself through a series of orgasms.

As she was winding down from orgasm number two and revving up for number three, she finally did hear approaching footfalls. Quickly, she slapped her clit as if to chastise a misbehaving kitten, and was forced to take Chris�s entire length and girth at once. Her eyes watered. Had she been wearing mascara it would have started running. Instead, she looked tired and sweaty, which she was. She was still pulling up her zipper when Jeanette entered.

�Quitting time, Yanique,� she said. Confidentially, she lowered her voice and said, �I know ju take jure clothes off, ees okay.�

Janique tried to give a rough approximation of a smile to Jeanette, but it was a cheerful grimace at best. At the door, the girls were already lined up. Since she had worked on her personal project after lunch, and started playing with it after break, that meant that she had been busy for two hours straight or more. It was a wonder she could walk on her unsteady legs. But when the door was opened for them to leave, there were additional guards. And they were patting everyone down, looking in their bras and panties.

Jeanette was just a few steps behind Janique.

�What�s this?� she asked her.

�Ees the new security procedures for the constructions,� she answered.

�Oh.�

�Ees no problem,� Jeanette said.

Janique was glad she felt that way, but it was a problem for her. The base and balls of Chris�s replica were still sticking out of her.

�They don� want people taking a drill beets and a screwdrivers,� Jeanette added.

Janique nodded absentmindedly. The scissors and such were checked in and out, eliminating most opportunities for carrying out something that could be used as a weapon. She bent over away from the line and began coughing violently. At the same time, she shoved the remainder of her new toy fully inside herself. It was all she could do to keep from screaming. She clamped down as if her life depended on it. And in a sense, it did. The laundry was one of the only two chances she had to see Chris, the other being her pretrial hearing.

One of the guards doing the searches was the one who had previously propositioned Janique and been rejected. She was last in line, and Jeanette was already moving to the head of the procession.

�Unzip your uniform,� the other guard said.

�No bra,� the other, leering guard said. �Very nice, great tits. Now pull your panties to the side and shake them.�

Before she could comply, the guard squatted down for a better view.

�What a fat little pussy,� she said. �And freshly shaved, too. What do you think, Georgia? Strip search? Cavity search?�

The other guard looked at her watch. �No time. Dinner. And I hate the paperwork.�

�Another time, then,� she said as Janique pulled up her zipper.

She walked back to the pod, fully humiliated, and not in a good way like when Chris did it, from a place of love. She vowed to get that guard at the first possible opportunity. And perhaps her accomplice, too.

Back at the pod, Lexi was a bit too overeager for her tastes, and she put her off for a few hours while she took a nap.

Janique had a nightmare. She was floating in a pool or tub and all around above her were faces from prison: guards, inmates, lawyers, staffers. They were all jeering at her, making catcalls and tormenting her. The waterline remained right below her eyes, and she was rigidly immobile, helpless. Each time she began to sink, Janique panicked and screamed. But she never actually went under water. Finally, in abject frustration, she screamed, �Chris, help me!�

At once, the many faces disappeared. She found she was able to raise her head out of the water, and there was Chris sitting by the edge, as he always did when she bathed.

�Ready to get out?� he asked, holding up a towel. He reached out a hand to steady her as he placed a fluffy yellow beach towel around her torso. Then he wrapped his arms around her and lifted her up, placing her firmly on the bathroom rug.

�All mine?� he asked her.

�Forever,� she answered.

At once, Janique was awake, her arms wrapped around herself, swaddled in her sheet and blanket. She lay there and cried for a few minutes. She thought that what she had experienced was called lucid dreaming, a technique Chris used to practice before he met her. When she once asked him why he had stopped, he shrugged his shoulders and said, �All my dreams already came true.�

The idea was that you could keep a portion of your conscious mind awake while you entered a dream state. You could do this by concentrating as you drifted off to sleep, shaping and changing your dreams as they happened. The other way was to simply recognize when you were dreaming, often by using a trigger of some sort. She decided Chris would be her trigger if the nightmares persisted. He wouldn�t let anything happen to her, even in dreamtime.

It was a soothing thought.

Finally in a better mood, she approached Lexi in her cell and sat down beside her.

�Do me, bitch,� she said with a grin.

The artist pounced on her, sucking and biting her neck where the tattoo was to go, and began mauling her tits, as well.

�Woah, woah,� Janique said. �I meant the tattoo.�

She pulled back. �Tattoo? Oh, yeah. The tattoo. Had to prep the neck area.�

�And my tits?�

�No, that was for me.�

They both grinned at this.

She drew the design on her neck, and Janique checked the placement in a mirror of polished stainless hanging in the bathroom.

�Looks good,� she said when she had returned. �Finish me off.�

The tattooist went to work with her scary and archaic-looking homemade needle gun. It was a small battery-powered motor that drove a sharp piece of wire wrapped in thread. Periodically, she dipped it into her pot of ink.

After she had finished the first pass, she asked Janique, �Need a break?�

Janique could only shake her head no.

�Okay,� she said. �This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me.�

This time, the pain was excruciating. It was all she could do to keep from screaming, or just slapping her upside the head. Instead, she called upon her martial arts training. Even so, she clawed holes in the sheets. When she was finally done, Janique fell back on the bed trembling. 

�You okay?� Lexi asked.

�Just give me a minute.�

�I didn�t think you could get any sexier��

As Janique lay there, Lexi went to the bathroom. When she came back, she had a sword drawn on her neck in black ink.

Noticing, Janique asked, �What are you doing?�

�I like it. I want one like that.�

�But this is my tattoo. I came up with it.�

�If you understand the meaning and the purpose of the sword, then you shouldn�t question my decision.�

Janique found she had to agree with this.

�So, we�re like sisters,� she said.

�Or a gang,� Lexi replied.

�I can live with that. Thanks a bunch, Lexi Girl. Enjoy the Cheetos and Ramen.�

She bandaged Janique�s neck after giving it one last kiss �to help it heal�, and Janique headed off to bed.

�Want me to help with yours?� she asked.

�I got it,� she said. �What sort of tattooist would I be if I couldn�t tattoo myself?�

�Okay. Goodnight��

Janique couldn�t wait to feel Chris�s mouth on her neck again. She noted that Lexi might do a good job of standing in for him sometime in the future. She was certainly aggressive enough, and with the replica in her hands�

After lights out, Janique masturbated furiously, her thoughts a swirl of Chris, Lexi, the replica, and inexplicably, the guard who had embarrassed her.

Then she enjoyed a deep sleep, free of nightmares.
13 � Construction Begins
Chris�s day began at five a.m., as it always did, but this time he didn�t go back to sleep after breakfast. Instead, he got ready for work. At seven, a pair of guards came for him. They brought him to an air-conditioned warehouse and left him to await his new boss, the warden�s brother-in-law.
�Where you guys goin�?� he asked. �You�re guards. Shouldn�t you, I don�t know, guard me?�

�You�re a trustee,� one said. �We trust you.�

So Chris just sat and waited. 

At almost eight-thirty, the contractor came in.

�Chris Turner? I�m Earl Warren. I heard you�re a pretty good hand.�

They shook on this. Chris could smell both beer and pot, and Earl�s bloodshot eyes and red nose told the rest of the story. He was a chronic alcoholic. He had with him three sets of prints, the old women�s prison, the old men�s prison, and the new combined facility. His heart tried to leap out of his mouth, and it was all he could do to act casual and not snatch the prints from his hands.

Mr. Warren rather ploddingly explained the situation.

�Now this is a hard money job. Do you know what that is?� he asked.

Chris shook his head yes but said nothing.

�It means that I get a set dollar amount to do it. So what I don�t spend, I keep.�

�Less kickbacks.�

�Right, less kickbacks. Wait, what?�

�I can help you save money,� Chris said. �Cost improvement, workflow analysis, and labor relations are what I�m best at.�

�Good to hear. But I need a working foreman. You can�t just lay up with the prints and straw boss your people.�

�I have always believed if you want something done right�� Chris said.

�That�s right.�

�What�s the labor situation?�

�I�ll let you assemble your own crew from your pod. If you can�t get enough people together, we can look at the prison as a whole.�

�Okay. What�s the QC setup?�

�The what?�

�Quality control. The process that guarantees the job is up to spec.�

�Uh, that�d be you. I mean, there�s a state inspector who signs off on the plumbing and gas lines. Just do everything right.�

�How about testing?� Chris asked.

�I don�t test lines. Too expensive. If it leaks, we fix it. I guess I could let you test stuff that run under the slab, things like that.�

�Is there a safety program?�

�Don�t get hurt. I mean, they�re convicts anyway, right?�

Chris ignored this. �The first thing I need,� he said, �is a copy of the state plumbing code. I�m a pipefitter, not a plumber.�

�Same shit, right?�

�The materials are sometimes the same for plumbing, HVAC, and pipefitting, but the installations can be different. That code book will insure we pass inspection,� Chris explained.

�I�ll get one,� Earl said. But he didn�t write anything down.

�The only other thing I see that we might not be able to do is the freon.� Chris said.

�I got a guy for that. I have guys for all this stuff, but I don�t want to pay them.�

�So where do we go from here?�

�Start with the material takeoffs. Well, after you give me the list of tools and equipment you need. Then you can start planning and scheduling.�

�What are we paying?� Chris asked.

�Paying? Nothing. Like I said, they�re convicts,� Earl said, ignoring the fact that Chris was one as well.

�No one is going to volunteer to work for nothing.�

�Look, I�ll feed them McDonalds every day, okay? And there may be other French benefits��

�Fringe benefits,� Chris corrected.

�Like these,� Earl said, and produced a rolled joint, a cold beer, and a lighter. �I�d go on the roof if I were you. As long as you stay in this warehouse, or on the roof, no one will bother you. Just familiarize yourself with the plans today, and I�ll send you back at three so you can recruit some help.�

He turned to leave.

�Hey!� Chris said. �Where are you going?�

Earl looked at his watch.

�Titty bar.�

And with that, he was gone for the day. Chris glanced nervously at the joint and beer he was holding, fearful of a setup. But no one came, so he grabbed the spec book, plans, and addendums, and went up onto the roof.

He downed the beer while it was still cold. Nothing tasted better than cold beer on a hot day. He decided he had little to lose, and so sat in the shade with his back against the wall as he lit the reefer. As he smoked, he thumbed through the spec book without much interest, as it was mere detail to accompany the blueprints. The addendums he would take with him to his cell. But he needed both hands to manage the prints, especially on the windy roof. By the time he had finished smoking, he felt great. He decided not to bother contending with the wind and heat and brought the plans back down after carefully disposing of the beer can.

When he got to the bottom of the stairs, he realized where he had just been. He dropped the books on a table and ran back up. He went around to the other side of the rooftop mechanical room where he had just burned one, and there it was. The entire women�s prison was on display to him. He couldn�t believe his eyes. It was roughly a mirror reflection of the men�s prison, with some minor variations. He squinted and strained, looking for Janique among the throngs of women milling about the yard. Chris knew he was well-positioned for escape, if only he had a way to break her out at the same time.

So close, and yet so far. The answers, he felt, were in the drawings. After an hour of thumbing through all three sets of prints, he felt he had a pretty good handle on the job. What�s more, a plan was forming.

###

Back at the pod, Chris was assembling a ragtag bunch of tradesmen for his crew. He knew Tokio was a pipe welder back in the days.

�Toke, my man.�

�Whadya� want, Turner? You ain�t never all upbeat like that.�

�I just got back from my new job.�

�So? Did they get new mops or some shit?�

�It�s construction.�

Tokio began to listen.

�And demolition,� Chris continued.

�I see.� 

�It�ll be great. No bosses. Make the days go by.�

�Yeah, man,� Tokio said, thinking of the simple joy of doing things with your hands. And then he caught himself and shook his head. �Aww, man. How you gon� try and Tom Sawyer me?�

�What?� Chris said, wondering if he�d broken some racial taboo somehow.

�Tellin� somebody something�s real cool, and they should hang out with you and help. Like Tom Sawyer and the fence.�

�Right. Well, it not like that. There�s food, freedom.� He leaned forward, and before Tokio could react, exhaled in his face while he said, �Smell my breath.�

�Motherfucker� you got beer? Shit, why ain�t you say so?�

�There may be other amenities as well,� Chris added.

Having recruited Toke, the rest was easy. By eight o�clock that evening, he had a carpenter, a sheetrocker, a mason, a painter, an electrician, and a fellow ironworker. He also signed on a few general laborers who seemed like they�d be hardworking and reliable. In all, he had eleven men, plus himself. And each came with their own set of demands. Given their dispositions, most of them wanted drugs and alcohol in addition to food from the outside. But several of them indicated that they wouldn�t mind a woman, were that possible. Chris remained noncommittal on this point but kept the possibility open.

He sent their names to the warden on a request form, so he�d have it first thing in the morning, then he set about on planning his tool and equipment requirements. Part of him felt sick, because work was taking him further and further away from Janique and the poems he wanted to write for her. On the other hand, it was the very same work that would bring them together forever. He resolved to work harder and do both. He stuck her book in with his addendum and tool lists.

At around ten-thirty, his weekly delivery of tar had arrived. Chris removed it from the foil, leaned down under his bunk when no one was watching, and smashed the sticky block against the black steel bedframe with the rest of his growing stash.

Finally, he tried to sleep, but it was hours before he could. His head was filled with plans and possibilities. Right before he drifted off, he kicked himself for not working on Janique�s new poem.
14 � A Dream�s Foundation
Janique awoke to a new day, excited by the possibility of seeing Chris. She turned her nose up at the bland grits, soggy toast, and reconstituted eggs, and instead munched on cheese, crackers, and summer sausage while she drank two cups of coffee.
Sometimes she felt bad about how hood rich she was compared to most of the pod. Many of the girls there hadn�t had coffee or cigarettes since they�d arrived. But she had learned early on not to be too sympathetic. If you started handing things out to people, it never ended, and at the end of the week your stash was gone along with your new friends.

Stealing was harshly dealt with in jail. However, if you �took� something, it was yours. One could just say, �I�m taking this,� and unless that person could somehow stop you, you kept it. Otherwise, your only recourse if something was taken from you was to �get on the button� or call the guards, in other words. None of these things affected Janique directly anymore. She shared with friends if the situation warranted it. No one was ever going to take anything away from her ever again.

She went to smoke, and admire her new tattoo. It really showed up well on her neck, and its presence excited her. Sometimes she wondered what Chris saw when he looked at her. He constantly told her that she was gorgeous, but for some reason, her self-esteem wouldn�t allow her to fully accept this. She tried to view herself objectively. She was petite and trim, with a genuinely nice body type. He said she was a white girl with a black girl�s ass, and she always laughed and blushed at that. Her face was cute, she thought, with a small but sensual mouth, freckles, and a button nose. But beautiful? Janique decided she�d defer to his tastes. He knew what he liked, and that was what mattered, in this case.

Before work, she saw two more girls with bandages on their necks indicating they�d received her sword tattoo. It was sweeping the pod, and she knew it was a matter of time before it broke out into the prison at large. It was becoming a movement. Because of the meaning imparted by the animated film they had viewed together, it was only worn by daring women with character and integrity, women of strength and a certain morality. Likewise, her repaired uniforms were becoming extremely popular in the Latino community, due to Jeanette propagating the belief that �LY� stood for �Latin Youth�.

Janique had instigated two burgeoning prison movements, entirely by accident.

###

Earl had apparently run the numbers and realized what a good deal he was getting because when Chris and his crew arrived at seven, he had full breakfasts for everyone. True to his word, it was from McDonald�s, but there was enough for twenty people. They ate every bit of it, and everyone who wanted more coffee had it.

Chris had calculated the beer and pot requirements to keep his crew happy and working and wrote them down for Earl, who didn�t even flinch when he read it, but folded it neatly into his pocket. They unloaded two gangboxes from the back of his truck while he made a few phone calls. He was having difficulty accepting the high cost of equipment rental.

�Do you really need a scissor lift, Chris? They�re fuckin� four hundred dollars a week!�

�Let me show you something, Earl.� He walked him over to the plans.

�This calls for four six-inch lines running eighteen feet AFF.�

�What�s that?� Earl asked.

�Above finished floor. A stick of six-inch weld pipe weighs almost five hundred pounds. You�re not going to hang pipe like that with ladders. Besides, we need to hang supports from there.� He indicated the ceiling. �We�re not going to keep the lift if we don�t need it. But for now, we definitely do. I�ll make sure I take it off rental as soon as I can.�

Earl seemed satisfied with this. He left to purchase all-thread rod, channel iron, and an oxyacetylene cutting torch rig. The welding machine had yet to be rented, and no pipe or fittings were on hand, so they spent the time before lunch dividing the work into manageable chunks, each area of the plans headed up by their respective tradesman.

But Earl didn�t return with lunch or materials until nearly two o�clock. They unloaded the channel iron and then wolfed down their food, practically starving.

�You know,� Chris said. �It doesn�t always have to be McDonalds, Earl.�

When they were done eating, Chris asked him, �When are the bottles being delivered?�

�Bottles? The beer?�

�The oxygen and acetylene bottles.�

Earl stared at him blankly.

�For the torch rig.�

�Shit, Chris, you didn�t say you needed those!�

�What do you expect to connect these gauges and hoses to, Earl?�

�Well, hell.� He made another call to the equipment rental place.

�Okay,� he said, hanging up.

�Bottles, jackhammer, and a scissor lift in the morning,� Earl said, resignedly.

�And the concrete cutter. Otherwise, the jackhammer�s no good.�

Earl sighed and picked up the phone again. When he was finished, he looked at his watch.

�Let�s go on the walkthrough.�

Chris gathered his men together.

�Alright, listen up, guys. We�re going to look at what we�re up against. This�ll mean touring both of the facilities we�ll be revamping. Right now, we�ve got it good. No one is watching us, and Earl is real cool about everything.

�The laundries are operational right now. I know most of us haven�t seen a woman in a long time, but if any of us get caught even talking to them, we�ll be off the job. So just keep your distance. Everyone on this crew is necessary to the project, and I can�t afford to lose you.�

He lowered his voice.

�When we get back from the walkthrough, we�ll get paid for today.�

A brief cheer erupted from the men. When they exited the warehouse, a single bored guard was waiting to take them.

�Everything okay?� he asked Earl.

�Fine and dandy.� 

The guard nodded and the tour began. Part of the old warehouse would contain the air handlers and other mechanical items, and the lines extended in two directions, toward the men and women�s laundries. Essentially, the wall between the two would be torn down, and a new, combined laundry would be built. Most of the walkthrough was only mildly interesting, and then only from a professional standpoint. But outside of the doors to the women�s prison, everyone perked up. The corrections officer radioed ahead to have the automatic gates opened in series. The group stepped through the first set, which closed behind them, and then the second gate opened.

They were in the women�s prison, which was the dream of many a man. Chris took a deep breath, and then led the group forward. There were women everywhere. From the gate to the laundry alone, they probably passed eighteen of them, trustees, female guards, and a group on their way to court. The crew was entranced. They only moved forward via inertia. Occasionally jaws would drop open. There was salivating. Chris only had eyes for one woman, and he kept them peeled for her.

The prison was abuzz with news of their arrival. Everywhere they went, they were greeted with wolf whistles and catcalls. For the first time in their lives, they knew how it felt to be a woman walking in front of a construction site. The women eyed them like choice cuts of beef. To Chris, it was worse than shopping at Wal-Mart. But inside the bustling laundry, they were scarcely noticed. The hot, noisy environment, with its activity and great clouds of rising steam, required too much focus for the men to receive more than a cursory acknowledgement from the women there.

As they walked the floor, he pointed out various landmarks and discussed the work that had to be performed, always keeping Janique foremost in his mind. He didn�t know why he expected to see her there, but he did. Unfortunately, she was nowhere to be found. It was too much to hope for, he decided. As they passed by a room off to the side, Earl took the lead, and Chris stepped through the door to take a look. He rounded a corner formed by racks of uniforms, and suddenly found himself face to face with Janique.

They both froze, neither really expecting to see each other under these circumstances. Jeanette was in the room with her, her back turned to them as she inventoried a rack of uniforms needing repair. It was all either could do to keep from crying out or embracing each other. Instead, they both held their breath and stood still. Janique turned her head to the side so he could see her tattoo. He was the person who had first showed her Heavy Metal. He raised his shirt, revealing �All Yours� tattooed above his waistband. A tear streamed down her face. Jeanette still never noticed his presence. 

With a sudden flash of inspiration, Chris pulled out her book and handed it to her. But at the last instant he realized he needed two pages from it. Unable to speak, all he could do was try and pull it back from Janique. But she refused to let go, and so he pulled her toward him along with the book.

They stood face to face for a moment, only a foot of distance between them. The tension was palpable.

�Yanique!� Jeanette said.

Janique release her death grip on the book, and Chris turned to leave.

�I was just handing him a book he dropped,� she quickly said.

�Well, okay,� Jeanette said. �He was cute, eh?�

Janique tried to smile at this, but she was too flustered. Furthermore, she was puzzled as to why he tried to give her the book and then took it back. She spent the remainder of her shift wondering about it, eventually deciding that he must have a good reason. She would have to wait and see. There was nothing else to do but put her head down and repair more uniforms.

Back at the warehouse, the crew was excited about the project. Just seeing real women and being near them was enough to fuel a month�s worth of fantasies for some of them. They went onto the roof to celebrate. Some drank, some smoked, and many did both.

�This is the deal,� Chris said, a joint dangling from his lips. �Weed before or during work, cigarettes all day, beer when we knock off. Cool?�

One or two people grumbled at this.

�I know, it doesn�t seem fair to drinkers. But in my experience, people don�t work well when they�re drinking. And if we drink all day, we won�t have anything left when we�re done. Don�t talk about this stuff with your cellies. All it takes is one hater to snitch and blow the whole operation.�

Satisfied that things were going well, Earl bid them farewell and turned them over to the guard for the evening. On the way back to the pod on the men�s side, Chris saw an �LY� jumpsuit for the first time and knew in an instant who had done it. It made sense. Janique spent her days sending him love notes in her own way. He was touched. It would all be damn romantic if it wasn�t so tragic. He resolved once again to get them both out of there. He didn�t see any jumpsuits like that in the pod, but he was certainly going to keep his eyes open for them next laundry day.

He spent the evening scanning Janique�s book for keywords. When he had found the two best candidates, he tore them out and stowed them away. It would be months before he would need to send them. As he tried to sleep, his mind returned again and again to their capture. He now thought he understood how it came to pass.

###

�There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face / She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race� � The Eagles


He and Janique were several months into their crime spree, heavily addicted to the adrenaline rush associated with armed robbery. Not to mention the pernicious pleasures of crystal methamphetamine. In many ways, it was the perfect drug for them. Then again, their love needed no such crutch in the first place. But like their BDSM explorations, meth was viewed as an extension and enhancement of their already rewarding sex life. Janique, highly sexualized and seemingly ever ready, was put into maximum overdrive. From the very first bump, she was on fire.

Chris loved to stand next to her as she did the initial blast, so he could smell her as she began to get wet. Janique had the sweetest, most flavorful, and aromatic pussy in existence. He made it a point not to touch her at all until her panties were visibly wet, or her thighs began to show rivulets of lubrication.

She was a lioness under any circumstances. On meth, she became feral, and nearly rabid. Twelve, eighteen, and even twenty-four-hour lovemaking sessions were not uncommon. This resulted in more than one emergency room visit before they learned to pace themselves. Even then, after they slept, they found themselves sore, cut, scratched, bruised, and even burned. They were often alarmed at the ferocity of their own love acts.

They employed no safe word or gesture. Chris operated on instinct alone, always providing Janique exactly what she needed at any given time. He knew this because he asked her about it often, early on. Even so, he worked to insure she bore no more than one mark on her body at once. This self-imposed rule of his was a challenging endeavor. It was later amended to mean no more than one mark of any one type at a time. Even so, he granted himself a lot of flexibility in this area. 

But the specific day that came to mind was a Sunday morning. They had done crystal and made love all of Friday night and most of Saturday. The rest of that day and night they spent asleep on the twin bed they shared, wrapped in each other�s arms.

Chris awoke before Janique and crept out to get her breakfast and a paper. They often enjoyed working the New York Times crossword puzzle together on Sundays. On the way back in, he checked the mail. In it, among other sundry items, was a catalog for emergency services personnel. They had gotten it sent to them primarily for cosplay. There were plenty of policeman uniforms, fireman outfits, and even clothes for ambulance drivers and other medics. Not to mention nightsticks, tensile bandages, handcuffs, and other items they could have fun with.

Janique flipped through the pages, circling things she found interesting. She never asked Chris for anything, but she did like to make things easier for him by occasionally dropping subtle hints. She found something extremely interesting, indeed.

�Look at this, honey,� she said, holding up the catalog.

It was a black box with a single red button on it.

�What is it?� Chris asked.

�It says it changes traffic lights��

Chris read the details.

�Wow,� he said, �this is a great find,� and then he gave her a kiss.

She began to pull him toward her.

�I thought we agreed, not before lunch?�

That agreement went out the window like a secret lover.

But a few hours later, Chris researched the traffic light changer heavily. There were a few caveats. First of all, only emergency responders could purchase them via the appropriate municipal agency. The other issue was that the serial numbers were registered and tracked. As near as he could tell, the units didn�t broadcast any information, so he wasn�t particularly concerned with the registration. Possession of the unit by civilians was a felony anyway, so those things only mattered if they got caught.

They both knew they never would. They used rented muscle cars acquired under false identities, bondage masks, and they never spent more than three minutes on a job. When Janique�s alarm on her watch went off, they hauled ass, money or not. Nevertheless, they had been involved in two high-speed pursuits. They�d gotten away fairly easily both times before multiple units could respond. But it would be safer if they could change stoplights, both from an accident standpoint and because they could use the cross-traffic against pursuers.

Being well acquainted with the underworld, getting his hands on one was relatively easy, if not particularly cheap. Municipal governments, Chris found, were highly corrupt organizations, where graft and bribery were commonplace. The triumvirate of money, sex, or drugs worked pretty much every time. In this case he had an inside man, a material expeditor, order one and then disappear it. Expeditors were masters of acquiring things and making them go elsewhere. Less than two weeks later, they had it in their hands. They tried it out on a few deserted side streets until they were satisfied with how it worked.

The first time they needed to use it was the day Janique almost died. It was also the day they decided to quit carrying loaded weapons. They were in the process of knocking down a small savings and loan when alarms sounded. Apparently, they had overlooked an employee in the back.

When the alarms went off, it was time to run, money or not. That was the rule. And they followed the rules, most of the time. Janique was running out the door with her finger on the trigger of her .38 special when she tripped on a small step between the entrance and lobby. Incredibly, on the way down she was thinking that there should be a sign or something. Watch you step, perhaps. When she hit the ground, the weapon discharged. The bullet passed through the underside of her chin, narrowly missing the bone, and came out of her open mouth.

An endless stream of blood issued forth. Chris forgot about everything but Janique. He scooped her up in his arms, grabbing the gun she had dropped and ran to the rented Challenger. As he sped away, he ripped off his t-shirt and tied it around her head, cradling her with his right arm as he drove.

He couldn�t bring her to the hospital, for obvious reasons. Instead, he hit up an unlicensed ex-doctor who was mob connected. By the time they had made arrangements, Janique had lost several pints of blood. Since they didn�t know her blood type, he gave her a type O transfusion. The doctor also hit her hard with sedatives because she and Chris were pretty amped up when it had happened. Eventually her heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing stabilized.

They were ready to operate. The doc told him to scrub up and handed him some Dawn dish soap, strawberry scented, he noted with a certain morbid amusement. Her face shone with serene beauty. Chris used a flashlight to peer into the hole in her jaw. He was extremely glad her teeth and tongue were undamaged. There wasn�t much he could do but hold her hand and occasionally pass the defrocked doctor an instrument or some gauze.

The hardest part was watching him sew Janique up. From the way the doc�s hands were trembling, it wasn�t much easier for him. But it was difficult to tell if it was the surgery that made him nervous or Chris�s presence.

Finally, the doctor said, �I�ve done all I can do.�

He instructed Chris on keeping her dressings changed, cleaning the wound, and avoiding infection. Less infection, he explained would mean less scarring. Janique didn�t awake until the next morning in her own bed.

�Ow,� she said. �Headache. Were we drinking? It feels like there�s something in there,� Janique whispered as she grabbed her head.

�There is,� Chris said. �Your sexy brain.� He kissed her. �Good morning. Uh, honey, I have to something to tell you.�

He watched her eyes widen in horror as he told her what had happened. Her hands went to her chin as he spoke. She started sobbing as he explained the extent of her injuries. He kissed and held her for hours, giving her endless reassurance that everything would be okay.

Chris cleaned and redressed her wound, and he never left her side. He read to her, fed her, even carefully made love to her, only leaving the room when she was asleep, and then only to use the bathroom or get her food. Each time she opened her eyes, he was right there next to her.

After two days, Janique insisted on getting out of bed. �I was only shot in the mouth, Chris. It�s not like I have a sprained ankle.�

He reluctantly conceded this point. But he still never left her alone and he always changed her dressings away from any mirrors, as the gash looked dreadful even when it had healed for a few days.

He was bathing her one day when the last of the scab fell off. Chris didn�t say, but dried her as if nothing had happened and kissed her forehead. He stood her up, wrapped her in towels, and closed her eyes. Then he positioned her in front of the mirror.

�You look even more beautiful now,� he said softly.

She opened her eyes and saw her reflection for the first time since the accident. Her forehead wrinkled as she searched her face for signs of injury. Finally, she tilted her chin up and saw it. It was a white, zigzagging scar that ran from the underside between her chin and throat all the way up to her jaw line.

Chris held his breath as he awaited her judgment.

�I like it,� she said finally. �But no more loaded guns, okay?�

�Agreed,� he said. At this point he realized he hadn�t used the traffic light changer in his rush to get her to safety. If he had, they�d have been caught even sooner.
15 � Steady Hustling
�She�d say faster faster, the lights are turnin� red� � The Eagles

Detective Chuck Segal stood in front of a map of the city, brooding over the rash of armed robberies the city had experienced recently. He was positive that they were being committed by the same individuals. He had no good photos, as they wore different disguises each time, but one picture was quite revealing. It showed the pair kissing through the zippered mouths of bondage masks. Male and female, he surmised. Sure, he thought, it could be two men or two women, but not in this case. He wasn�t sure why, but it had a real �Bonnie and Clyde� feel.

He placed a pushpin on the map, marking the latest traffic light believed to have changed unexpectedly. The pushpins seemed to be rather randomly scattered, but Segal felt the makings of a pattern there. Given enough time, he knew he would all but have their address.

Within two months� time, the pins described a circle around their neighborhood, with dots within the circle practically pointing to the building they lived in. By the time of the pet shop robbery, the apartments were being watched.

###

Janique was elated at having seen Chris for the first time in months. Miracles really do happen, she thought. She walked back to the pod after her shift, but she couldn�t remember her feet touching the ground.

Back inside, it was the same old story, for the most part. The girls who left the pod only for thrice-weekly exercise sessions swarmed the ones who worked, seeking to escape their situation momentarily by being regaled with tales of the outside. Such as it was. And there was a lot to tell, for a change. The talk was a lot more licentious than normal, due to their relatively close contact with men. Even the devoted lesbians in the bunch seemed interested. If not in the men directly, in the feelings they aroused in their cellmates.

Janique likened them to sharks, or perhaps piranha. They circled and swam through the groups, smelling the blood in the water, looking for the perfect victim, a new conquest. Others would find solace in each other�s arms, reinforcing the belief that men were the source of the world�s problems, not a solution.

She never needed a hot shower so bad in her life. Since the dawn of her sexual awakening, she always had Chris to satisfy her every need, want, and desire. Now she only had memories, and the replica. But as she isentered her cell to retrieve her shower supplies, she heard faint sobbing noises next door. It was Jill, ostensibly her daughter. Time to get into mommy mode, she thought. Or daddy mode, in this case. She brought her shower things with her, the replica tucked inside of her towel.

Jill lay on her stomach, clutching her pillow and crying into it. Janique knelt beside her and rubbed her back soothingly.

�What�s wrong, honey?� Janique asked.

�Nuh-nothing,� the girl replied.

�Come on. It�ll be okay. Talk to Daddy.� 

Janique felt odd saying those words, referring to herself as daddy. Not wrong, just odd. There was a sexual connotation to it that she hadn�t perceived before, furthermore. Upon hearing that, Jill�s crying lessened, and she turned to look at her. Her big, brown eyes glistened, wet with tears, and framed by impossibly long lashes.

�I killed my f-father,� she said in an angry whisper.

�Ssshh,� Janique said. �It�s gonna be alright.�

�Is he gonna be not dead?� the girl asked sarcastically. �I miss him.�

Janique thought about how she missed Chris and empathized with her. She missed her father as well, but with far less intensity. 

�I�m sure you had a good reason,� Janique said.

�I really didn�t. I went crazy. I never told anyone this, but I was mad because he wouldn�t fuck me. Not that I asked him to. But, you know, because we couldn�t. And I went crazy. I�m a virgin. Are you?�

Janique had suspected as much but didn�t comment on it.

�Like Lizzie Borden,� she said.

�Who?� the girl asked.

Janique recited, �Lizzie Borden took an axe, gave her mother forty whacks. When she saw what she had done, she gave her father forty-one. Some people believe she had experienced a similar, momentary madness. Did you know doctors used to masturbate women?� 

�No.�

�It�s true. Virginal women were granted no release. This went on from the Victorian era to early 1900�s America. The older they became without gaining sexual satisfaction, the crazier some of them would get. So, their families would bring them to doctors, and they knew what to do. Give them an orgasm and pow, cured.�

�Nuh-uh!�

�It�s true. There are even all sorts of medical devices from back then, all of which were actually vibrators or something similar.�

�You�re really smart, Johnny.�

�Thanks.�

�And sweet��

Janique had only intended to give her a comforting, parental kiss, and she was shocked at how powerful this mix of taboos could be. She found her mouth opening of its own volition; her tongue had a mind of its own. She loved the feel of her skin, which was entirely distinct from the feel of the white women she had been with previously. Jill�s lips were as full and kissable as the rest of her ample flesh. They melted into each other. Her scent was intoxicating.

Janique�s hands decided not to wait on word from her, and instead they made their way up the inside of Jill�s shirt. Her nipples were as stiff and erect as the erasers which slip over the ends of pencils. When finally they broke the kiss, it was only so Janique could raise Jill�s shirt and bra.

Upon feeling Janique�s mouth upon her, Jill began to moan and squirm. This only increased the fervor with which she attacked those great mounds of flesh, nearly suffocating herself with them. One thing definitely led to another, and Janique soon found herself touching Jill�s pussy with her right hand and her own with her left.

Finally, Jill could take it no longer.

�Fuck me, Daddy,� she said.

Janique fully intended to. It was, after all, part of her role in this makeshift family, and therapeutic, besides. That, and she was voraciously horny. In her haste to remove Jill�s pants, she inadvertently knocked over her stack of toiletries. But the pants did come off. Jill was quivering, and Janique could smell the delectable scent of her sex. The panties, however, remained on. Janique pulled them to the side and began slowly and methodically licking her from top to bottom.

Her gyrations increased in time with Janique�s quickening tempo. Soon, too soon, Janique felt, Jill reached her first orgasm, holding her breath and screaming through her closed mouth. Neither of them heard Mica enter the cell. She walked in on them and then silently backed out of the room again. She took Janique�s sheet from her bunk and covered the outside door. Then she came back in. 

At once, Janique�s pants and underwear were around her knees. She never stopped her attention to Jill, but instead wiggled her ass provocatively. As she moved her finger to her hymen, Mica spread Janique wide and spat inside her. Not that she needed the additional lubrication, but it was a domination move she was long familiar with. The replica was poised just as Janique�s finger was, and both entered together.

For Janique, the illusion was an effective one. Her own orgasm began to build as her finger punctured the thin layer of flesh that separated Jill from womanhood. The combination of sensations both mental and physical took her over the brink. Mica drove the replica home, and both Janique and Jill orgasmed together, finally collapsing in a heap.

�My turn,� Mica said, as she positioned herself between the two and straddled Jill, leaving the replica still lodged in a twitching Janique. They spent nearly three hours together, missing dinner entirely. When they did finally emerge, it was to a round of applause.

###

Chris hustled that next morning to be sure he was in and out of the laundry early. When Janique came in for her shift, the Tom Robbins novel was waiting for her on her workstation. Having accomplished that, he gave Earl a list of items he wanted for the next day.

�Son, have you lost your mind? This is three, four hunnert dollars� worth of stuff that ain�t even construction related!�

�According to my copy of the timetable, you hit your first milestone with the completion of the underground. That means you just got around two hundred thousand dollars. I realize you have materials and expenses to pay for, but three, four hunnert, as you say, is a drop in the bucket. Especially, if you want to make the next milestone.�

To his credit, Earl turned red, but he didn�t yell or argue.

�When do you need it?� he asked, exasperated.

�This afternoon would be great,� Chris said in all seriousness.

�Maybe tomorrow,� Earl said.

Chris was in no mood to argue over something that was clearly non-essential to the project.

�Tomorrow would be fine,� he said.

Earl left them to their work. The supports were in place in the warehouse, and it was time to rack some pipe. Chris went and pulled Tokio, who was cutting channel iron and blowing holes in it with a torch. He was only happy when he was burning something, it seemed.

�Toke, I need you to straw boss these guys while I plan the next phase. Cool?�

�Yeah, man, we cool. I�m thirstin� anyway.�

Tokio had the only other key to the ice chest that held the beer. The first time Chris noticed him opening it, he wanted to tell him something, but he was too important, and they were also good friends. Besides, he knew the deal, and drank the few beers he had each day in the janitor�s closet, where they all used the mop sink as a toilet. When he emerged, Tokio picked out a four-man crew. He brought them over to a bundle of six-inch pipe. Each stick was twenty feet long and weighed almost five hundred pounds.

�I want that pipe in that rack,� Tokio said.

Three of them shook their head in affirmation, and the fourth said, �We can�t do that!�

Toki brought him over to a pile of chainfalls, come-a-longs, shackles, and rigging. He pointed at a chainfall.

�What�s that?� he asked the skeptic.

�I don�t know,� the kid admitted.

�And you call yourself a construction worker?�

�Actually, no. I grow weed mostly. But I�m a painter, so Chris needed me for later.�

�This is a chainfall, it�s a geared lifting apparatus with an anti-slip mechanism. What�s its rated capacity?�

�Uh, three tons,� he said, looking at the label.

�Then you can definitely lift six-inch pipe with it. You watch them three. Stay on the ground and pull the chains when they tell you to.�

Two of them went up in the scissor lift and hung two chainfalls from the perlings in the roof.

�Now run that hook down,� Toke commanded him.

The kid pulled on one chain and the other until he figured which was which. When the hook was touching the ground, Tokio grabbed a two-foot-long yellow nylon strap, a choker, and showed him two ways to use it.

�This way,� he said, �is called cradling.� He put the choker under the pipe and brought both ends up on either side of it.

�And this is called choking.� He pulled one end of the choker through the other end. �I want you to always choke pipe when you lift it. Okay?�

The painter shook his head yes.

When they had racked four sticks, Tokio had them hang two come-a-longs at the end of the supports, and then use them in conjunction with the other chainfall to slide the pipes down the rack.

When they had moved all four down about twenty feet, they racked four more sticks. This time, Tokio went to Chris.

�I need a blunt.�

�Clearly,� Chris said, �We�re going to have to up our allotment soon.�

Half of the daily weed went to Chris and Toke, and their tolerance was building.

�Roll you own blunt, fool,� Chris said. �I�m the boss.�

�Shit,� Tokio said, �Welders run this motherfucker!�

He rolled himself one and brought two of his pipe crew up in the rack with him in the lift.

�That thing is only rated for two people,� Chris yelled up at him.

Tokio shot him the bird. He grabbed two squares and a sleever bar from the lift.

�Okay, you two cats get out,� he told them.

They looked at each other, and then back at Toke.

�If you�re scared, say you�re scared.�

They said nothing.

�Look,� Tokio told them, �There are safety harnesses down there. In my experience, they just get in the way. My advice? Don�t fall.�

�Okay, I won�t,� one said.

�Now take these two squares and start aligning these pipes so I can tack �em. Use the bar if you need to move �em side to side, and raise the hanger if the heights don�t match.�

�Uh, Tokio?�

�Yeah?�

�Couldn�t we pull measurements from the wall, and align them that way?�

�Yeah, we could. Or we could do it right. I mean, I hear what you�re sayin�. But the pipes have to be square with each other. Nothing else matters. Look.�

He put a square on each pipe.

�See the difference, side to side? When the squares touch, you�ve made your fit. I�ll be right back, I�m gonna get my hood and leads.�

On the ground, he called for the painter kid to come over.

�Hey, Chainfall,� he said.

�My name�s Paul.�

�Well, now it�s Chainfall. Tie these welding leads to the scissor lift.�

�Hey Toki,� a voice called from above, �How do we get over there?�

Tokio looked up, and one of them was pointing to the next pipe hanger.

�Walk the pipe,� he yelled up at them.

�They roll!� the kid said.

�Then hang on to the perlings!�

When the first four fits were made, Tokio came back up in the lift, unlit blunt in his mouth.

�Y�all want to hit this?� he asked them.

�What, up here?� one asked.

Tokio lit the blunt and put his hood down. Thirty minutes later, all four lines were tacked up.

He yelled to his pipe crew, �Send up four more.�

They repeated the process all day long. By quitting time, the entire run of four lines was hanging in the rack. Earl wasn�t back, so Chris got a headcount and brought the crew out to the guard.

Back in the pod, Alvin approached him.

�I have a new issue for you, Turner.�

Chris was seriously starting to regret his involvement in this murder-for-hire scheme. At the time, it seemed a means to an end. Now that he had the construction project, he saw new avenues open to him. But to try and back out now would be a death sentence.

�Oh, yeah?� Chris said.

�You�ll like this. He�s your bunkmate.�

Rolando was a relatively transfer to the pod. He was short and quiet, and seemed to be a decent individual. Suddenly Chris�s desire to not know any details about the hits worked against him. Then again, if he knew more, he might not go through with it.

�Now?� Chris asked.

�Tomorrow would be fine.�

He needed a plan. He went into the bathroom, found the cleanest toilet, and stuck his hand up the drain. Yeah, that�ll work, he thought. Chris couldn�t bring himself to talk to his bunkmate, or even look him in the eyes, knowing he would dead tomorrow evening.
16 � Willie Wonka
Janique�s day also started out well and ended badly. She went in to work and was delighted to find that Chris had already been in and brought her novel back. Having him so near her was exciting, even though he was probably there an hour earlier than she was. The book held a lot of meaning for her, obviously. It brought her back to better times, when they lived simply, making love, occasionally eating out, and going to the beach or movies.
Chris read, and she listened with rapt attention. There were many times when they both felt every word was written about them, or for them. It was magical. That first novel came to represent their shared dreams and aspirations. They vowed to one day marry and honeymoon on Maui, see the big banyan tree, and visit the Lahaina Bar & Grill as depicted in the book.

Somehow, they never had. Life got in the way. They became so wrapped up in each other that nothing else seemed to matter at all. What was the point of Hawaii when you never left the hotel room? Not to mention the daily grind of life. Robbing banks and stores was still a job. Bank security had improved to the point that they could rarely get more than ten thousand for a bank. Chris said he had an idea for a big score, but he never told her his plan.

And it wasn�t about things. They mostly robbed because it was fun and romantic for them. Sexual. The money was secondary, and allowed them to be together twenty-four hours a day, year-round. Of course, they didn�t foresee prison. 

No one ever does.

Janique smelled the book. His scent was on it. She held it to her chest and daydreamed about being reunited with Chris. Eventually, she slipped it into her jumpsuit, which she kept on for that reason alone. She drifted through the day on a cloud, number nine. Her production was way down, but she still managed several repairs with her trademark �LY� embroidery. Her hands did the work, but her mind was elsewhere.

She went back to the pod that afternoon still in a daze. It would have been a great day if it hadn�t been for movie night. It was a fairly new flick, �Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon�, and it got the pod fired up. Any hint of sex or violence usually did. Janique loved it. She loved the Chinese girls, so beautiful and full of dignity. Plus, they kicked a lot of ass.

When the movie was over, everyone wanted more action. They were milling about speaking to each other in Kung-Fu movie clich�s, complete with bad lip sync, when the tall girl who had previously wanted to fight approached her. Her recent transfer had already brought a lot of tension to the pod.

�You have disrespected my family name,� she said. 

Janique decided to play along.

�Your family name is without honor,� she said to the girl.

�Ooooooh,� everyone in earshot said. Which is probably what caused the fight.

�Bitch, what?� the girl said.

�Perhaps if you cleaned the filth from your miserable ears, you�d hear me more clearly,� Janique told her.

Dispensing with words, the girl assumed her fighting stance.

�Battle me, or wear the shame,� she said.

�My only shame,� Janique said, �will be in beating so unworthy an opponent.�

Janique stood relaxed, completely at ease. She noted that the girl�s stance was flawed.

�What�s your style?� the girl asked.

�You shall see when you make your move. What crane style is that? Whooping crane?�

�Fittin� to be whoopin� your ass!� the girl yelled as she charged, letting her rage get the best of her.

Janique sidestepped her in a graceful move that looked like yoga. She went down on her right knee a bit and extended her left leg diagonally, tripping the rushing girl. For good measure, she gave her a chop to the neck. Not a particularly hard one. It was more of a warning shot. The crowd was in an uproar. They formed a circle around the two and egged them on. A few bets were placed. 

Undaunted, the girl sprang up from a shoulder roll and spun to face her, already panting heavily. She unleashed a flurry of combos that Janique readily countered. As she backed off and attempted to regroup, Janique held up one finger, leaving the girl puzzled as to what she meant. Nevertheless, she again tried to crowd her with a new series of kicks and jabs.

Each time, Janique warded off the blows, but didn�t counter them. Instead, she put increasing force into every block, so that every attack from the girl caused her to hurt herself more. The scuffle had taken them to the edge of the crowd, and in a flash, Janique had been tripped. At once, the girl was upon her, as the martial arts battle degraded into a hair-pulling slap fight.

The girl had an obvious height and weight advantage over her. She hit the ground with an audible crunch that knocked the wind out of her. The girl took advantage of this moment of weakness and managed to get her hands around her throat. Before she began to black out, Janique did the only thing she could under the circumstances. She brought her knee up hard and hit the girl in her undefended stomach. It was enough to get her to release her grip, and both leapt up to continue the fight.

Janique was at this point ready to end it, having suffered the ignominy of dirty fighting. The next time the girl threw a round of strike attempts, she blocked them all again and delivered a single knockout blow, leaving the girl sprawled on the concrete, sleeping like a baby.

She stood over her vanquished foe and bowed slightly. Janique went to bed amidst mutterings that she had beat the girl too hard. 

In her cell, she reconstructed the novel from the poems Chris had sent to her before giving her the book. But when she scanned through it, she noticed that two pages were still missing. She hoped that meant she was going to get two more poems, because she had really enjoyed them. Some had a lyrical quality that reflected the mood of the book itself. As she prepared to doze off, Janique wondered if it was worth the risk to try and communicate directly with him. In the end, she decided to leave things the way they were. 

She liked surprises.

###

The next morning, Chris and Tokio stood at the foot of the pipe rack, looking wistfully upward at the four lines.

�That�s a lot of weldin�� Chris said.

�I either need a helper to run the grinder, or another blunt.�

�Two blunts a day?�

�That�s a lot of weldin�,� said Tokio.

�Take Chainfall Paul. See if you can make something out of him. And don�t let him get hurt.�

Tokio grumbled.

�And we�ll see about another blunt after lunch,� Chris added.

�Now you�re talkin�.�

Toke happily went off to work, unlit blunt clamped between his teeth.

�Keep your hood down,� Chris called after him, meaning, �Don�t stop working�.

Earl dropped by, and he seemed enthused. 

�All the crazy stuff you ordered will be delivered around eleven,� he told Chris.

�Actually, Earl,� Chris said, �If you read the addendums, there�s a landscaping clause. Using this warehouse as a greenhouse, we can deliver top-quality plants for next to nothing.�

�Addendum, eh?� Earl asked.

�Sure, you did read them before you accepted the job, right?�

�You keep me updated.�

�So, when does the chiller get here?�

�Chiller?�

�Right. The chiller, air handlers, and the cooling tower.�

�Huh?�

�Yeah it�s all tagged �MC�. Managing contractor supplied, it gives all the specs. Looks like a nice unit. Weighs a little over eight tons.�

�Eight tons? What does that cost?�

�Well, I�m no expert, but I�d expect around one point two million dollars. With the other stuff you need, probably two million.�

�Two million!� Earl exploded. �I don�t have two million dollars!�

�You bill it through the prison. It�s deducted from the operating budget.�

�My money,� Earl said numbly.

�You gotta spend money to make money, Earl my man,� Chris said. �And that�s not counting all the ductwork.�

�Ductwork?�

�Earl, we�re installing HVAC, here. You can�t have air handlers without something to move air through.�

Earl looked morose.

�Just tell me what you need for ductwork, and I�ll order it.�

�Oh, we can�t do ductwork. It�s a specialized trade, and it requires a fab shop. You�ll have to sub it out. I�d say that�ll cost six hundred thousand.�

Earl was on the verge of tears, having lost three million dollars before breakfast. He staggered off in search of a bottle and didn�t return that day. As he said, however, the planters, potting soil, seeds, and other items, along with numerous rose bushes in full bloom, arrived before quitting time. Chris signed the bill of materials, and then helped the driver unload it all.

When they were done, the driver said, �Oh, I almost forgot.�

From the seat of his truck, he produced a crystal vase wrapped in tissue paper.

�I didn�t want this to get fucked up,� he said. �It�s nice.�

Up in the rack, Tokio and Paul shared the second half of the blunt, watching the delivery of the landscaping materials.

Paul immediately began to get ideas.

�Tokio, how wide is that column?�

�What, that? It�s three feet square. Why?�

�Do you think you could see me if I stood in the middle of it?�

�Well, let�s just find out.�

Paul climbed out of the lift and made his way along a beam until he was close enough to be able to climb across by using the perling. It was a thirty-foot drop. With steely determination, he forced himself to climb hand over hand until he was safely standing on the column.

He shot Toke a thumbs up and Tokio took the scissor lift to the ground. Once there, he got down and walked around, occasionally looking nonchalantly up at the column and surrounding skylight. Finally, he got back on the lift and drove as close as he could to the column to pick him up.

�Can�t see shit,� Tokio said.

�Dope.�

But they each had different ideas. Paul wanted to grow weed, and Tokio was silent on the matter.

When they went back up, Toke said, �Don�t bother, it�s lunchtime.�

They waited five minutes or so and went back down. While everyone was eating or sleeping, Paul filled a five-gallon bucket most of the way with potting soil and covered the top with tools. He put it on the lift and added a gallon of water for good measure. Then he ate lunch. 

After Tokio�s customary forty-five-minute nap, he awoke to grab a sandwich and harangue Chris for his other blunt. He explained to Tokio that Earl had left in a hurry earlier, and he hadn�t come through with the new allotment yet, but finally relented and gave him the rest of the day�s supply, which amounted to a considerable cigar.

Tokio and Paul went back to work, welding, grinding, and talking.

�I sure would like to get out of here,� Tokio said as he lit the afternoon blunt.

�We all would,� Paul agreed. �But how?�

�It could be done,� Tokio said. �By a desperate lifer such as myself. Not for some old pot charge like you got.�

�How?�

�Ah, the devil is in the details.�

�What does that mean?�

�Just feather those tacks.�

Meanwhile, Chris was busy filling up flowerpots with soil, mixing fertilizer, and watering in seeds and bulbs. The afternoon sun shone brightly through the skylights, and he knew they would thrive in the warm, dry warehouse. He arranged the mature rose bushes into two short rows and made note of which blooms were the nicest.

###

Janique�s day was uneventful, for the most part. She went in thinking of Chris and was only a little disappointed that he didn�t make another appearance in the laundry. Still, he was nearby, and thinking about her as surely as she was thinking about him. She shivered in her jumpsuit despite the warmth of the room.

After the nine o�clock break, Jeanette came in to see her. She no longer checked on her progress, but she did like to visit and gossip. On this particular day she could hardly contain herself.

�Yanique, I yam so happy!�

�Why�s that, Jeanette?�

�My nephew Rolando is getting paroled this week!�

�Oh, that�s great!�

�I know, okay? He was in here tree years.�

�Wow, that�s a long time.�

�They want him to give the grand jury hees testimony.�

�That�s great,� Janique said, already back to daydreaming about Chris. Jeanette was such a nice lady. She was glad her boss was happy. But in her mind, he was running to her, arms outstretched. He would grab her and spin her around, then set her down and squeeze her tightly. After her back had cracked, he would cover her face and neck with kisses. He would slide his hand under her skirt, and�

The spool on her machine jammed, ending her fantasy for the time being. Her fantasies often started out romantic and ended with her a helpless prisoner, subjected to Chris�s cruel whims. She was so hot she felt she would combust. Without her book to hold in her jumpsuit, there was no reason to keep it on, she thought, and stripped down to her underwear. It didn�t make her any cooler, but at least she could touch herself easily. Janique hoped tonight Mica would play along with her and pretend to be Chris in the dark.
17 � Another Body Murdered
Before it got too late, Chris got a bandsaw and angle grinder. He cut a flat piece of metal and wrapped one end lightly in duct tape. To the other end, he applied an edge with the grinder and worked it into a fine point. Once he was satisfied it would do the job, he secreted it in the bottom of his sock. When they headed back to the pods, they had to leave their steel-toed boots behind and wear prison-issued sandals. Oftentimes there was a pat down, and for the first few trips, a metal detector was used.
One hung there on the wall as they changed footwear. There was a moment of tension when the guard walked over near it, but he never took it down. Chris was out of his work boots and into the flip-flops before the guard searched him, so his socks were never checked. 

Once inside, he stashed the shank in the toilet. They were designed to prevent anything from being hidden there, but when he turned it sideways it stayed resting lightly against the outflow of the bowl.

He flushed it a few times to make sure it wouldn�t become dislodged, then went about his usual evening routine. It was time to begin the demolition of the inner walls of the two laundries, so Chris studied the three sets of plans and made notes until he decided to retire. At three a.m., when the pod slept the deepest, Chris put his hand over a sleeping Rolando�s mouth and cut his jugular vein. The entire move took thirty seconds, start to finish.

He left the pillowcase he had used to keep the squirting blood off his knife hand with Rolando and pulled the covers up over his head. No one would even know he was dead until the noon rollcall. Chris was never suspected at all.

He kept the shiv with him and brought it back to work, where he cut it into pieces and threw it with the other scrap metal Earl intended to haul off and sell but never did. It was the first murder he felt uneasy about, although he wasn�t sure why.

Once at work, he quickly trimmed a few select roses, some fern, and baby�s breath, and put them in a tool bag with the vase. He explained to Earl about the upcoming demolition, and the two of them took an early morning trip to the laundry. Chris didn�t have an opportunity until Earl�s cellphone began to ring. It was his bookie, and the two talked at length about the upcoming weekend�s football games.

He ducked into the repair room and pulled out the vase and flowers. They seemed wrong sitting in a dry vessel, but he found a few gallons of demineralized water for the irons and filled it. Finally, he felt it was a suitable gesture worthy of the love of his life. Satisfied, he told Earl he was ready to go back to the warehouse. Once there, Chris reminded him of his agreement to increase their daily pot allowance. Earl pulled a quarter pound from under the seat of his truck. 

�Here,� he said. �Just tell me a few days before you run out.�

�Thanks,� he said with sincerity. It would certainly keep Tokio happy, at any rate. Chris was too concerned with the dual problems of the construction project and trying to see Janique to worry much about anything else. When studying the routing of the gas main, he had an epiphany. But to make it work, he had to learn her route and schedule.

He went to Tokio.

�I need Chainfall tomorrow,� Chris told him.

�Fuck that noise,� Tokio said. �Every time I get some helper trained, he gets pulled. I put up with it for twenty years. But no more, today I-�

Chris held up two blunts.

�Deal,� Tokio said.

�It�s just for tomorrow,� Chris added.

�Don�t matter,� Tokio said. �I don�t work without a helper.�

Chris knew he was just giving him a hard time. Toke couldn�t sit still all day unless he was sedated. If there were welds to make, he would make them. They went back to the pod after work, and there was nothing but drama going on.

�Your bunkie is dead,� someone told Chris.

�What happened?� Chris asked.

�Shanked,� they told him. �Somebody took his ass out. Snitch. Probably the Mafiosos Mexicanos.�

Chris nodded his head in agreement but said nothing and so the inmate wandered around to further spread the news like some malignant town crier.

�Did they toss the pod?� he asked someone else.

�Yeah. No weapon though. I bet it�s in someone�s ass.�

Casually, Chris knelt down to get something out of the cubby beneath his bunk, so he could be sure his heroin was undisturbed. But when he felt for it, it was all there, now a thin flat rectangle almost six inches long.

Alvin couldn�t resist talking to him about the hit.

�Good one, Turner. Pretty bold, sleeping next to a corpse to avert suspicion.�

In his bunk, Chris could still smell the acrid tang of Rolando�s blood, and he slept fitfully throughout the night. He dreamt there was a fire. He and Janique were trapped in a burning building, and he couldn�t find her. Desperately, he called her name to no avail. Yet he knew she was in there with him, somewhere. The smoke forced his eyes closed, and the heat was making his skin blister, but he persisted, crawling blindly from room to room so that he might rescue his lost love.

A door opened to the outside, and Chris was faced with a choice. Save himself, or save Janique. But it wasn�t a choice, really. Even in a dream, he couldn�t live without her. He went back toward the fire to find her, and died where he collapsed, twenty feet from safety.

Chris sat up in his bunk, covered with sweat. He got up to shower before work, and was more determined than ever to see her, and soon.

###

Janique walked into the repair room and her heart skipped a beat. A cluster of butterflies performed an impromptu air show in her stomach. Chris had been there, and recently. On her workstation was an arrangement of large red roses in a crystal vase. It brightened her day so much to look at them, it was almost like having him there. She remembered telling him once that she didn�t want flowers to become routine, and had come to regret it, because she had gotten them more and more infrequently as time went on. But this bouquet certainly went a long way toward making up for that.

She worked until the three o�clock break before she realized Jeanette wasn�t there, and decided to stretch her legs a bit. She asked around until finally a girl named Iris told her that Jeanette had a family emergency of some sort and wouldn�t be in until the next day. Probably a sick kid or something, she thought.

Janique had to leave her flowers at work, but she added sugar and ice to the vase to extend their shelf life as long as possible. She did, however, take a single bloom back to the pod in her underwear, and slept with it on her pillow. She dreamt with a smile on her face.

###

Earlier that day, before the laundry started their shift, Chris had Earl bring him and Chainfall to the laundry on the pretense of having him pull measurements for light fixture placement.

In fact, Chris needed info on Janique�s schedule. They carried a large extension ladder over to a wall.

�Paul, I need a favor.�

�Yeah?� He was just happy to be off the grinder.

�Can you watch these women for me, today?�

�Watch women? Yeah, I think I can do that, boss.�

�Specifically, there will be one coming in here in forty-five minutes or so. She has flaming red hair. You can�t miss her.�

�I need more info. Big tits?�

�No, you don�t. But, yes, petite frame, fairly chesty. I want you to tell me what time she gets here, where she goes, and how she gets there. At the end of the day, do the same thing in reverse.�

�So, watch these women all day?�

�Right. From up there.� Chris pointed at the ceiling. �If you walk the beams, you should be able to see anywhere.�

�Anywhere?�

�Except the bathrooms.�

�Damn.�

�And keep your dick in your pants, okay?�

�How do I go to the bathroom?�

Chris handed him an empty plastic quart bottle.

�Put this in your lunchbox. And don�t come down. If you do, we all get fired.�

�You owe me,� Paul said.

�Fair enough,� Chris replied.

He returned to Earl, and they headed back to the warehouse.

�You sure he�ll be alright?�

�Of course. Chainfall has never let me down,� Chris said, trying to make a joke.

�You�ve known him for a month, maybe,� Earl said, unamused.

�Touch�. But don�t worry.�

When they got back, Tokio was welding, as predicted, and the rest of the crew was finishing up the patches to the concrete where the drains were added.

�That shit better not leak,� Earl said.

Chris sighed. �It was rigorously tested and certified leak-free by the city inspector. Remember?�

�Oh, yeah. I didn�t even have to bribe him.�

�Just make sure you come back at five so we can get Paul.�

�Alright. Do we need anything?�

�We�re good,� Chris said. �We�re going to start the demo work tomorrow, so we�ll need the threading machine next week to run the gas lines. But for now, it�s going to be assholes and elbows with the sledgehammers and demo saws.�

�The dumpster will be delivered today.�

�Great. Nothing relaxes a man�s mind like destroying stuff,� Chris said.

Earl left, off to do whatever Earl did, and Chris worked on the isometric drawings for a revision he made to the gas line. The demo work involved removing the dividing wall between laundries and building a chase along the exterior wall where the new water and gas lines would run.

He estimated that one thousand cinder blocks would have to be removed by hand, in pieces.  The new chase would be constructed out of two by fours and sheetrock. Once he had completed the drawings, he made a take-off of the additional materials he would need for that phase of the project. The time flew by, and soon it was four o�clock. Chris decided to shut down early.

�Safety meeting on the roof,� he told Chico. �Round �em up, tell �em to put everything away.� 

Chico the sheetrock lead nodded and scurried off to do as instructed. Chris stood under the rack and called up to Tokio. When he had his attention, he made the universal sign for �break�. Toke nodded his head, then dropped his hood and went back to work.

Ten minutes later, he was on the ground.

�Hadda finish the weld,� he explained to Chris.

They joined the rest of the crew on the roof with a case of beer and a fistful of blunts.

�Safety meeting!� Chris yelled as they began distributing the party favors. 

�Anyone get hurt?� Tokio asked.

Everyone shook their heads no.

�Here, then,� Tokio said. �I rolled these, and they will definitely hurt you.�

The bottles were passed around, and most people downed the first immediately, then opened a second one. Chris gave an impromptu motivational speech.

�I really just wanted to get everyone together and take a little break. You�ve all been doing great work, and I appreciate it. We have a new phase coming up. We�re going to be working in the laundry directly. We�ll be erecting a visqueen dust barrier, and tearing out a wall. Also running electrical conduit and moving washers and dryers.

�I just want to stress that our position is tenuous. Bad behavior on our part can sink this project and send us all back to the pod for the duration of our sentences. No more fun. Having said that, there may be an opportunity to get some pussy. I recommend you take it, if so.�

Murmurs bubbled up from the crew as they considered the possibilities.

�So, keep up the good work. Tokio, do you have anything to add?�

Toke thought about it for a moment.

�You motherfuckers are alright,� he said, lighting his blunt.

�And there you have it,� Chris said.

It was by then approaching five o�clock, so everyone finished what they had and cleaned up. Chris hung the weed on a piece of tie wire and lowered it down into a piece of ductwork that penetrated the roof, twisting the wire around a screw so it could easily be retrieved. Around the same time, the guard assigned to escort them back to the pod, his first assignment at his new job, got curious and stuck his head in the warehouse to see� nothing. The people he was assigned to watch were all gone.

He began panicking, blowing his whistle, and calling for help on the radio. A minute later, an alarm sounded throughout the prison.

On the roof, Chico asked Tokio, �What�s that?�

Tokio shrugged his shoulders. �Escape attempt,� he said. �Riot. Fire. Whatever it is, it don�t concern us.�

But moments after they came downstairs, eight guards burst through the warehouse door, shotguns drawn.

�Get on the ground!� one of them yelled.

Tokio�s voice cut through the stunned silence.

�I ain�t gettin� on a motherfuckin� thing,� he said.

No one moved.

Just then, Earl walked in the other entrance. One gunman quickly spun to face him. Earl was so bewildered, he put his hands up.

�What�s going on?� he asked no one in particular.

�Escape attempt. Get on the ground,� the guard repeated.

Earl started to go down, but then caught himself. He quickly performed a headcount.

�Who escaped?� he asked.

�We don�t know yet.�

Earl straightened back up.

�Then why do you have guns pointed at my crew?�

�Uh,� the guard said.

�How many people are on your list?� Earl asked.

The guard laboriously counted the names.

�Nine,� he said.

�And how many people are in this room?� Earl asked.

�Nine,� he said. �But it was empty! They were gone.�

�We were on the roof,� Chris said. �We�re installing two sixteen-ton air conditioner units up there.�

�Well,� Earl said, �You�re fired,� and led his men out of the warehouse and toward the pod without the benefit of an escort.

Back in his bunk, Chris could finally relax, having achieved his current goals. 

Paul! He had forgotten about Chainfall Paul at the laundry. He quickly leapt up and hit the button. After some explaining, a guard went off to retrieve him.

�You dick,� Paul said when he got there, �I can�t believe you forgot me. They were real assholes about it, too.�

�Poor baby,� Chris said. �Did they hurt your feelings?�

�Is that any way to talk to the guy who has the information you want?� Paul asked.

�Spill it,� Chris demanded.

�Well, she�s fuckin� beautiful,� he began. �Her hair is longer and redder than you described. And I think she wears thong panties.�

�So, what�s her route and schedule?�

�In at eight a.m., lunch at noon, she leaves at four. She went to the bathroom twice, but I doubt those are regularly scheduled.�

�And the route?�

�Easy, guy. I made you a map.�

Chris accepted it and studied it with interest.

�I had a lot of time on my hands,� Paul said. �She comes in and out the same way.�

�Chainfall,� Chris said, �I owe you one.�

�I know,� Paul said.

�How about guards?�

�No guards in the laundry. Just the boss lady. She�s in her office most of the time.�

�Thanks, Paul.�

Chris began scribbling notes based on the drawing. Paul realized he was engrossed and wandered off to talk to Tokio.

�Damn, Chainfall. Where you been?�

�I was taking measurements at the laundry. Did she sprout?�

�Shit, I don�t know. I�m not climbin� over there to check. It�s your baby.�

�I need to rig a watering system.�

�Way ahead of you, dog,� Toke said. �Just run a hose from the roof to the plant through the glass. Then all you do to water is go on the roof and pour.�

�Can we disguise it?�

�Paul, you�re a construction worker now. You can do anything.�

�The fuck I am,� Paul said, smiling.

�Paint the hose white. Chris has a little glass cutter in his box. Less chance of getting caught if you�re not over there fondling it every day.�

�You have to spend time with them. Talk to them,� Paul said.

�That also applies to wives and girlfriends, Chainfall. Remember that.�

Paul looked sheepish.

�Hey, I wish someone had hipped me back in the days, too,� Toke said. �I was all about the hustle. That was three wives ago. And let me tell you, all that hustle money don�t warm a man�s heart. Dig?�

Paul nodded.

�Most cats in here have no love for bitches, and that�s a fatal error. It�s probably why most of them are in here. Even the most world-beating pimp needs someone in his corner. Someone who�s real.�

Tokio looked dreamy-eyed, and Paul felt uncomfortable.

�On the other hand,� Toke said, �An unloved woman is like a dangerous animal. You�re better off alone than with some girl you are bullshitting. Hell hath no fury, Chainfall. Hell hath no fury.�

�Huh?� Paul had to ask.

��Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned� is the complete quotation. Which means, basically, fuck with their hearts and they will ruin you. Take it from me, I learned the hard way.�

�I hear you,� Paul said, in hopes of ending the awkward conversation.

�Good. Now get up on outta my face, I�m tryin� to relax.�

And so the evening passed. Tokio ruminated on lost loves, Chris devised a plan to see Janique, and Paul dreamed of his first and only girlfriend, Mary Jane.
18 � Janique and the Hitman
Janique was still flying high, but she was due to have a little wind let out of her sails. On this day she had gotten up early, foolishly perhaps, in order to put on makeup for Chris, on the off chance that she would see him today. He always told her that she was the most beautiful girl in the world, and that she didn�t need any, but when she did put it on, she took his breath away.
She had a new jumpsuit she�d been working on. The cleavage area plunged to her bellybutton. Over her chest and on each asscheek was a red embroidered heart. Vaguely, she realized she should probably keep her clothes on as long as the construction was going on. She�d hate to get someone fired.

She lit a cigarette after she�d finished and then put it out. Janique was losing her taste for tobacco. Even the now nightly trysts failed to please her more than superficially. She needed the deep and abiding joy a woman could only achieve in the arms of a man that loved her. No sex or drug could come close to substituting for that. Her love for Chris was the closest thing she had to a religion. She had an unshakable faith that they would be reunited and would be together forever. She didn�t know what lay beyond the realm of death for her, but she knew he would be right there next to her for all eternity.

At work, her jumpsuit chafed at her most pleasantly, her every nerve ending on edge. When she walked into the repair room, the flower arrangement brought her desires to a hard boil. She no choice but to rub her pussy on the spot until she came, shuddering and sweating.

She didn�t see Jeanette that morning, and Janique assumed she hadn�t made it in again. I hope she�s okay, she thought.

Later that afternoon, she walked into the repair room. Janique was glad she was dressed.

�Hey, Jeanette!� Janique said. �How are you?�

At the sight of her, Jeanette collapsed into her arms, shaking and crying. 

�Yanique! They keel heem!�

Janique tried to comfort her as best she could.

�Who?� she asked. �Who killed who?�

�R-Rolando,� Jeanette managed to utter.

�Your nephew?�

�Uh-huh,� she said.

Janique hugged her tighter. �Oh, Jeanette,� she said, �I�m so sorry.�

Eventually the sobs quieted, and her shudders were reduced to mere shivers. Still, Janique held her until she said, �I�m okay,� and pulled away.

Janique was incensed. Jeanette was far too kind to be subjected to this sort of trauma. She held both her hands and met her eyes.

�Jeanette, listen to me. We�re going to get whoever did this to you. Okay?�

Jeanette said nothing. Janique squeezed her hands.

�Okay?� she repeated, more forcefully.

Jeanette nodded.

�It wone bring Rolando back,� she told Janique.

�I know. But don�t you want to get whoever did it?�

�Jes,� she said. �I want them dead.�

She spit on the floor.

�We�ll get them,� Janique told her.

Later, back at the pod, Janique wrote a friend of the family and asked them to procure a thousand dollars for her. Then she waited for Amy to make her nightly rounds.

�Hey!� Amy said. �I haven�t seen you in a while.� 

Janique had someone else get her Marlboros, lately.

�I need someone killed,� Janique said.

�In here?� Amy asked.

�On the men�s side.�

�Oh, yeah, that can definitely be made to happen. Who?�

�You�re pretty matter-of-fact about murder for hire, Amy.�

�It comes with the territory. And I get ten percent.�

�I see. Well, I need whoever murdered Rolando killed.�

�They don�t have a suspect for that.�

�Damn.�

�I�ll find out. Or I have someone who knows, rather.�

�How much?�

�Five hundred for the hit. Fifty for me. Fifty for the info.�

�I�ll have you a thousand tonight. I really need this to happen. Spend what you need and keep the rest.�

�I never saw this side of you either, Janique. It�s sexy.� 

She smiled at her, and Janique smiled back.

�Well, if I�d known I would get this reaction, I�d have killed someone sooner.�

�I�ll keep you updated. And throw in a few extra packs of smokes.�

�Thanks, Amy.�

Janique went to the restroom and brooded. She was so occupied with her thoughts that she smoked an entire red, which she hadn�t done in a while, and then vomited into the toilet.

�Fuck this,� she said, and left the pack on the sink.

###

Chris was chomping at the bit to get back to work, but when they lined up at the door, the guard consulted a list and said, �Not you,� when Chris tried to leave. �You�re meeting your attorney today.�

He knew public defenders were more than useless, since they essentially worked for the prosecution, but also that it was useless to argue. Tokio would run the show in his absence, but Chris hadn�t shared his plan for the next phase with anyone, so the real work would remain undone until he got back.

They called for him around nine-thirty, and it was frustrating knowing that half the day would be blown before he got back to the job. Chris sat in an empty room for another twenty minutes before the public defender arrived, with only his thoughts to occupy him. 

He was a stereotypical fellow, with greasy hair and a disheveled suit. PDs were never very aggressive, which is why they all failed at being regular defense attorneys. He consulted a list of client meetings scheduled for the day.
 
�Turner, Chris?� he asked, and Chris shook his head yes.

His attorney raised his hand to shake Chris�s, even though they were separated by a thick pane of plastic. 

�Charles Bukowski,� he said, �Public defender.�

Chris looked at his hand and his mood darkened a little, causing his attorney to drop it.

�I know what you�re thinking. The Charles Bukowski?� he asked.

Chris said nothing.

�He was a delightfully alcoholic writer, now long dead, I believe.�

Chris remained impassive.

�I�m afraid I�m not much of a legacy, as far as namesakes go. But I do my best.�

�When�s the trial?� Chris asked.

�Your preliminary hearing is today,� his lawyer told him.

�What?� he snapped. �Will Janique be there?�

�Your co-defendant will plead separately at another time. But you�ll be tried together, unless she plea bargains or otherwise cuts a deal. Does that sound like something she�d do?�

�No. Are you her lawyer?�

�Goodness, no. She has the best legal team money can buy.�

�Can they try us together with different lawyers?�

�I think, Mr. Turner, you�ll find they can do almost anything they want. However, had I a keen legal mind, I would file a motion to try her separately, were she under my representation.�

�Why?�

�To get her off, of course. Pin the blame on you. There are any number of ways to do it. You were abusive and forced her, blackmail, brainwashed.�

�In love?�

�Perhaps. I just want you to know what we�re up against. If you two were married, I could prevent her from being forced to testify. Of course, if you two were married, you wouldn�t be facing a felony kidnapping charge, either.�

�She wasn�t involved in anything. I did force her. Can that be part of the plea?�

�I�m afraid at this stage, it�s guilty, not guilty, or no contest, strictly. The rest will come out at trial.�

�Fuck.�

He�d never considered the possibility. Chris found that his thoughts about the trial were just as romanticized as the robberies they�d pulled off.

�Anyway, here�s the charges and the evidence they have against you both. You have an hour to prepare and decide how you�ll plead.�

�An hour?�

�Well usually, I�d meet you outside the courtroom about five minutes before the hearing. But since you�re facing eighty years��

�Eighty!�

��I thought I�d give you more time.�

Bukowski passed the folders through the drawer under the partition.

�I�ll be back in fifty minutes, if you have any questions.�

Chris spread the folders out before him and opened the one labeled �State�s Evidence�. In it, among other items, were nine different photographs of he and Janique, at four different banks. They looked pretty menacing in their bondage masks, but he knew they were smiling underneath them most of the time. In one photo, a bright shock of Janique�s hair had escaped, laying across her shoulder like an upside-down question mark.

They had also seized the Camaro, various weapons, drugs, and the red-light changer.

They were sunk, Chris thought. The best he could hope to do was shoulder most or all of the blame. He turned the case over in his mind while studying the details. Janique had most of the same charges as he did, except for his kidnapping rap. Both were charged with second-degree murder for the owner of the pet store. The way he saw it, they couldn�t have it both ways. If he kidnapped her, she probably wasn�t culpable of the robberies. But he knew they�d try and play it like that to maximize the sentences.

For the first time since they had begun their crime spree, he began to know fear. He wasn�t going to outwit the prosecution from a legal standpoint. At best, he could minimize or eliminate any threat to Janique. But to do so would mean he would effectively spend the rest of his life in prison. And he would, for her. But he knew it would kill them both.

Escape was his only real option.

He tried to follow the case against him, but it was largely circumstantial. A real lawyer could probably get him off. But all of their money, the money Janique didn�t know about, was inaccessible. And even if it were, he had no one he could trust outside of Janique. As far as she knew, there was only her wedding ring.

The ring was an exquisite monster, as jewelry goes. Its centerpiece was a flawless five-carat diamond in a setting of white gold and platinum. They had been scared to have it properly appraised, but they knew it was worth more than sixty thousand dollars, retail. It was the result of a burglary Janique had arranged. One day she came upon an obituary by chance, the mother of someone she knew from high school. Her family was not only extremely well-off, but ostentatious. Janique called and offered her condolences, and was subsequently invited to the wake.

At first she just saw it as an excuse to buy a hot new black dress and veil. She would wear it in front of Chris before they left for the wake, but she wouldn�t let him make love to her until afterward. Perhaps she�d pretend to be a grieving widow.

Eventually, she remembered the dead woman�s ring. It was quite possibly the most enthralling piece of jewelry she had ever encountered. Ordinarily, she selected jewelry based on how it made her look and feel, not price. But this ring occupied some magical intersection of beauty and excess. It was tasteful, and the size and value gave it a deliciously sinful feel. And it would even fit her. Both the woman and her daughter were five-sixes, although they lacked Janique�s exaggerated curves.

When she told Chris about it, his interest was piqued. �Sounds like it would make an excellent wedding ring,� he said, and she leapt into his lap, arms around his neck. The plan had always been marriage and Hawaii, but there was no specific timetable, so it excited her to no end that they were making moves in that direction.

The irony was that Janique owned nearly twenty wedding dresses. Some were in tatters, two had never been worn, but she had a collection that rivaled some boutiques. Chris loved to shop with her and frequently picked out outfits for her. He definitely had a fetish.

They arrived for the wake dressed to the nines, if a little too provocatively. Janique was in fine form with a slinky black cocktail dress, which was strapless and ruffled at the hem. On her head she wore a black pillbox hat and veil. Her hair was swept up, exposing her neck. Black high heels and stockings set off the ensemble.

Chris wore a tuxedo with a black shirt, which he somehow managed to make look entirely too festive. He strove to appear somber, but he was enjoying the surroundings so much, amusement kept creeping onto his face, despite his best efforts to look serious. It was an open casket viewing. When they saw the body, Janique was relieved.

�I was worried she�d be wearing it,� she whispered.

�I�d have gotten it anyway,� Chris replied.

Janique looked at him somewhat mortified, and then saw the expression of love on his face. At that point, she realized she would wear it with pride, even if it was the product of graverobbing. Luckily, that wasn�t the case.

She decided that she needed to get upstairs without arousing suspicion. And there was an upstairs bathroom in the hallway next to the master bedroom. She explained the hustle to Chris, who immediately went into action. He found the single downstairs bathroom, which was briefly occupied, and waited. When that person vacated, he went in and locked the door. Shortly thereafter, Janique approached her grieving friend.

�Simone, I hate to bother you, but I�ve had too many glasses of wine, and I really need the bathroom. I don�t think I can wait much longer.� 

Janique gestured toward the door. �Someone�s been in there for a little while now,� she said.

�Oh,� her friend said. �Just go upstairs, it�s okay. You�re practically family.�

�Thanks a bunch.�

�No problem. Do you remember where it is?�

�Of course. High school wasn�t that long ago.�

Simone smiled a sweet, sad smile at this.

�Are you going to be okay?� Janique asked her.

�Sure, I�ll be fine. It�s just a shock. Thanks so much for coming, Janique.�

They embraced and kissed in that strange upper society fashion where your bodies don�t touch, other than your arms and shoulders. It might have been awkward, but both girls had been raised on air kisses and fake hugs. Then Janique stepped past the velvet rope that had been erected to keep people downstairs and ascended the grand, curved staircase.

She closed the bathroom door with the light on and entered the master suite. She found the jewelry box on the dresser, just as she had remembered it. The drawers were well sorted and brimming with valuable baubles. There was a section for pearls, gold, and gemstones, but Janique didn�t see any diamonds, much less the ring she came for. On a second pass, she realized that the trays were removable, and there it was. It looked even bigger and more beautiful than she had remembered. She dropped it into her clutch, turned off the bathroom light, and rejoined Chris.

They stayed and mingled for a long while, not to avoid suspicion, but because they were enjoying being out among other people for a change. Finally, it was mutual. Time to go. They said their goodbyes and walked out into the night.

Once at the car Chris said, �Give it to me,� and Janique began to hike up her dress and bend over the trunk. Chris turned her around and kissed her. �I meant the ring, silly-ass.�

�How about both?� Janique asked as she handed him the ring. Chris examined it in the moonlight.

�Finally,� he said. �A ring worthy of your finger.�

He surprised her by getting down on one knee.

�Janique Tamerlane Patton, you are the love of my life and my soulmate. I have always been in love with you. I will always be in love with you. I want to love and cherish and care for you until the end of time. Won�t you please do this roguish heart proud and give me your hand in marriage?�

He bowed his head before her. In the manner of a queen knighting a loyal servant, she placed a hand on his shoulder. 

�Rise, my husband. We already are, remember?� she said, referring to her piercings. �But I guess we should make it legal. I could use a new wedding dress anyway.�

She threw her arms around him, peppering his face and neck with kisses. Then Chris pushed her an arms length away from him. He grabbed her hand and raised it to his lips.

�Forever,� he said, and slid the ring onto her finger.

�Oh, Chris,� she said. �You may kiss the bride.�

Janique pushed his head down, and that was all the prompting he needed. He pulled her panties to the side, and soon she was pulling him back up by his hair. He positioned her so they could both see the house in case anyone came outside, and entered her under the moon and stars.

Back at home later that evening, Janique handed him the ring. 

�What?� he asked.

�I can�t wear this every day. Not in this town. But keep it safe for me, okay?�

He assured her he would guard it with his life.

A few weeks later, while rummaging around at a thrift store, Chris found a Wal-Mart work shirt and had a flash of inspiration. He bought it without telling Janique about it, lest she become concerned.

After a few weeks of research, he put on a short-haired wig and fake moustache and walked into an out-of-town store in his work shirt, carrying a cardboard box for some electronic item they sold there. The helpful Wal-Mart greeter cheerfully put a smiley face sticker on it, enabling him to walk out unquestioned later. It held nothing but old newspapers.

Chris wore a nametag, keys, and this was the clincher, a radio. In both construction work and retail, the people with radios are in charge. No one questioned him as he made his way into the back of the store. Right on time, he saw the store manager go into her office ahead of him. The Brinks truck was due in thirty minutes.

Chris confidently walked in behind her.

�May I help you, uh, Carlos?� she asked.

�S�,� he said. �I have this box, and I need it full of cash.�

Her eyes grew wide as he produced a pistol and some rope from his pocket.

�I can�t open the safe, it�s a time lock, I-�

An alarm sounded and the safe opened, exactly as he had planned it.

�Don�t try and bullshit me, mi mujer. Jure the manager. The armored car is due in twenty-six minutes. Two armed guards will arrive to take possession of the store�s receipts, which they will then deposit with Texas Federal Bank. How am I doing so far?� he asked.

�Stupid Mexican asshole,� the woman spat.

�Now, now,� he said. �Let�s not be bitter. Ju were careless and complacent. They probably won�t fire ju. Although I wouldn�t count on making corporate any time soon.�

Her brow furrowed.

�Now be the nice lady and fill the box.�

She looked from Chris�s eyes to the gun and back again. Then she bent down and opened the door to the safe. He dumped the newspaper on the floor and set the box beside her. She sighed resignedly and began transferring stacks of banded cash from one to the other.

�Thank ju, Carolyn,� he said.

�Fuck you,� she said under her breath.

�Now is that any way for a lady to speak?� he asked her.

When she was done, she said, �Okay.�

�Do ju have any tape?� he asked politely.

She rolled her eyes at him, but pulled a roll of packing tape from a desk drawer. As he taped the box closed, she said, �They�re going to catch you. I�m glad. I hope you rot in prison.�

Chris stood there looking at her for a moment, and then placed a piece of tape over her mouth.

�That�s better,� he said.

He had planned to tie her upright in her chair, but her attitude irked him. He pulled her roughly around to the front of the desk and pushed everything that was on it to the floor. Chris tied one end of the rope he carried to her left wrist, and then forced her to lay facedown. He thought about just tying her across the desk, which would have been humiliating on its own, but he didn�t like her tone. Instead, he raised her skirt and exposed her panties, passing the rope between her legs before tying it to her other wrist.

The woman struggled and strained but was ultimately defeated by the rope. As Chris walked out the door, he could see her panties darkening, he wasn�t sure if it was sweat or excitement he was seeing. Probably both, he decided. He walked out whistling, unnoticed. The box was decidedly heavier than when he�d walked in. At the front door, the greeter implored him to have a nice day.

�Oh, I plan on it, thanks,� he said. 

Back at home, Chris counted the money. It was a little over two hundred and seventy thousand dollars.

The following week he and Janique did what they had to do to secure a safety deposit box at the bank. He told her it was for the ring, and never let on about the money, which he dropped off later. He thought it would make a nice down payment on a house in Hawaii, eventually. Little did he know at the time that he may never see it again. Either he or Janique could access the box, but no one else.

If he thought she could use it as bail he would let her be released and then get him out and they could flee. But he hadn�t been charged with the Wal-Mart heist, and trying to make bail with unlaundered robbery money would get her a new charge and cost him more than a quarter million dollars.

After fifty minutes, Bukowski returned.

�Well?� he asked Chris.

�Not guilty.�

A line of worry crossed his lawyer�s brow. �They�re going to give you the maximum,� he said. �If you can plead guilty, I can probably get you a flat ten.�

Chris thought about this. In ten years he�d still be under forty, fit and healthy. But ten years without Janique? He�d rather have his hand cut off.

�Can�t do it,� Chris said. �If I cop a plea, I can�t exonerate Janique.�

His lawyer sighed. �They don�t teach you about love in law school,� he said. �Well, let�s go plea. I�ll see you in a few.�

Almost as soon as he exited and walked down the corridor, Chris was let out of the conference room. The guard led them both toward the administrative block.

�Are you riding the bus with me or something?� Chris asked out of curiosity.

�Bus?�

�To the courthouse.�

�Oh, that. No, we do it by teleconferencing now,� his lawyer said.

Chris was relieved. It looked like he�d make it to work before noon, at least, and he could begin the next phase of his plan today. A few minutes later and he stood with several other defendants before a large television.

�Kinda impersonal, ain�t it?� he asked his lawyer.

Bukowski shrugged his shoulders. �That�s just a sentimental holdover, seeing the judge to plea. I expect in a few years it�ll just be a form you fill out that gets processed by a clerk.�

�I guess. It�s kinda weird, though. Like being sentenced by robots or machines.�

�That not far from the truth,� his lawyer said. �A lot of these judges are pretty mindless.�

The guard stood by as Charles signed them in. They still had to wait twenty minutes for the judge to switch on his camera. They sat on a bench with a few other lawyers and defendants while they waited. When the judge finally appeared on the monitor, the guard became part bailiff.

�All rise! The honorable Judge Bert Ernest presiding.�

The inmates all looked at each other, unable to believe they were told to stand in the presence of a television. But their attorneys did stand, and so they wisely went along, aware that the judge was watching them. Predictably, they went in alphabetical order, placing Chris at the end of the queue. Three other defendants pled guilty to lesser charges, each amounting to less than a year in prison, when you factor in good behavior.

Finally, everyone�s attention was on Chris.

�Christopher Jacob Turner, you are charged with second degree murder, felony kidnapping, and four counts of strong-arm robbery, as well as four counts of criminal conspiracy. How do you plead?�

�My client elects to stand mute, your honor.�

This was the best they could come up with. �Guilty� or �No Contest� wouldn�t help Janique, and Chris didn�t want to get off on the wrong foot by lying to the judge and declaring himself not guilty.

�Very well. We�ll set the trial date for one month from now, on the first of June.�

�Thank you, your honor,� Bukowski said in response.

At least we�ll be together for our anniversary, Chris thought.

By the time he made it back to the job, it was one-thirty, and the day was blown. When he got there, Tokio was asleep in a chair, a lit blunt hanging from his lips and a beer in his hand.

�Rollcall!� Chris shouted in his ear.

Tokio�s eyes opened and he began to spring from the chair at once. The beer bottle crashed to the ground and broke. Chris caught the blunt and began to finish it.

�Triple slippin�,� Chris said. �This is what I get when I leave you in charge?�

�Bein� a foreman is thirsty work,� Tokio replied.  He gestured up in the rack, where Paul and several others appeared to be working furiously, cutting holes, and fitting the weldolets and associated trim.

�What if a guard would have walked in here?� Chris asked.

�After Earl got that one dude ran off, I don�t think another guard will step foot in here. Do you?�

�No. But you still need to be more careful.�

�What they gonna do?� Toke asked. �Send me to jail?�

�No, they�d lock you in the hole and take your beer and weed away.�

�Point taken,� Tokio said, signifying that Chris should drop it.

�Anyway, you have something like twelve weldolets and eight more connections to make. You should-�

All at once, Chris saw a welding arc, and a stream of hot slag began to fall from the rack.

�What the fuck?� Chris had to ask.

�Chainfall Paul. My motherfuckin� apprentice,� Tokio said.

�Come on, man. This ain�t some trade school, we got shit to do. There�s no time to teach people a new craft. We also don�t want to fix a bunch of leaks.�

�They won�t leak,� Tokio said with confidence.

�You have a painter doing pipe welding, and you say there won�t be any leaks?�

�I taught Chainfall one hundred percent welding techniques, what we use for industrial work. It takes a little longer, but it will never leak. In fact, those would pass an x-ray. Paul has a good eye and a steady hand, plus he�s smart.�

�I guess,� Chris said. �You have to fix any leaks, though.�

�If there are any, they won�t be at the welds,� Tokio said. And he was right.

�So, what do you do now?� Chris asked.

�Welding foreman,� Tokio said, grinning.

�Well, Mr. Foreman. Grab the hundred-foot tape, chalk line, and the linesaver. We have a middle management meeting on the roof in five minutes.�

�At two in the afternoon? Shee-it,� Tokio said. �It�s hotter than a motherfucker.�

�You�re right,� Chris said. �Roll another one and bring some beers.� He took the blueprints to the roof and waited.

When Tokio arrived, he broke the blunt in two and each smoked his own half while they worked.

�We have to lay out the pads for these air conditioning units,� Chris said. �This is our control line,� he said, pointing to a seam in the middle of the roof. �I already did the figuring. We just need to mark off the corners so the guys can form them up.�

He called out figures as Toke stretched the tape and marked out the corners of the pads. By three-thirty, they were finished. He gave his material list to Tokio.

�Have your rodbuster double-check my figures. Tell him we don�t want to haul up a foot more rebar than we need. The �crete truck will be here Thursday. Friday, we fly the units.�

�What about the demolition?�

�We start with the visqueen tomorrow, too.�

�Let me guess-�

�That�s right. The roof is yours.�

�Fuck.�

�But so is the demo. Be patient. When I talk to Janique it�ll be on like a, uh, a slate of something I can�t read.�

�That is a terrible analogy.�

�I realize that.�

###

Back at the pod, Alvin soon set upon Chris, grinning like a skeleton.

�Turner! I have a new job for you,� he said.

�Oh, yeah?� Chris asked.

�I need you to kill yourself.�

�Very funny.�

�You laugh, but I�m serious. There�s a hit out on you.�

�What?�

��Tis true, �tis true. Five hundred dollars to see you dead. That�s a lot of Ramen.�

�By who?�

�I don�t know. Like you, I often don�t know. Luckily, I don�t need the money, but I do need you. Plus, I hate getting my hands dirty. And I don�t like Ramen.�

He managed a disarming smile, but the visage of death still lurked behind his fa�ade.

�Anytime you think you�re ready Alvin,� Chris said in a low voice.

�Chris buddy, if I was gonna kill you, I wouldn�t tell you beforehand.�

�I fail to see the humor.�

�Come on, you have to appreciate the irony.�

�I don�t have to do anything,� Chris said.

For the first time, a dark expression fixed itself on Alvin�s face.

�If you want the dope to keep coming, you�ll do what the fuck I say, junkie.�

Chris lowered his eyes sullenly and said nothing.

�There�s a good lad. Run along now, Chrissy. I�ll let you know when I have something for you.�

If anyone else had heard Alvin�s demeaning remark, Chris would have been obligated to kick his ass, at the very least. He wanted to do much worse. But he knew he just needed to bide his time. He currently needed him. Not only for the smack, but because he was a back-up line of communication between him and Janique. Without him, Chris ran the risk of losing touch with her if either of them lost their jobs somehow. 

He fretted and fumed all night, despite his resolve.
19 � Lie Down With Dogs
That same day found Janique outside of the office of the warden on the women�s side, puzzled as to why she was there. Ultimately, she was unconcerned. As far as she knew, she was as clean as she could be. There had been no recent fights, and she�d almost quit smoking entirely. She hardly felt the warden was concerned with her sex life, such as it was.

After a brief wait, the receptionist told her that she could enter. The warden sat behind his desk, which was bare, save for a single folder marked, �Patton, Janique.� There wasn�t even a nameplate to let her know how to address him.

He looked up at her from the page he was currently reading and shot her a disarming smile. He was a black man in a Stetson, not unattractive, she noted without really thinking about it. Since his mood was jovial, and she had nothing to hide, Janique decided to take a wait-and-see attitude, rather than going on the defensive.

�Miss Patton, have a seat.�

�What�s this about, Mr�?�

�Warden.�

�What�s this about, Mr. Warden?�

�I�m receiving some distressing reports regarding gang activity in my prison, and your name keeps coming up.�

�Mine? Absurd.�

�Is it? On two separate occasions, individuals have received serious beatings for stealing. Each time, the assailants bore tattoos like the one on your pretty white neck. Care to explain?�

�What�s to explain, Warden? It sounds like people should learn to respect the possessions of others.�

�What about the tattoo?�

�What about it? Lots of people have tattoos.�

�You didn�t have it when you got here. Neither did they, I checked.� 

�And? Having a tattoo doesn�t make me a bad person.�

�No, beating an old man to death and robbing banks makes you a bad person.�

Janique frowned at this mischaracterization.

�I didn�t-�

�That�s for a judge to decide.�

�Do you have a point?�

�I do. From here on out, I�m holding you responsible for anything any girl with a neck tattoo does in your pod. The next felony assault will be tacked on to your other charges.�

�But that�s not fair, that�s-�

�Life isn�t fair, Ms. Patton. Regardless, you would do well to implore your podmates to cease with their dispensing of old west style justice.�

�I�ll try Warden. But I�m no gang leader. There is no gang.�

�You�ll succeed, or you�ll be punished. Either way is fine with me. This is, after all, a penal colony. Punishment is what we do best.�

�Cocksucker,� Janique muttered under her breath.

�What�s that?�

Janique said nothing.

�If you�re no gangleader, then why did you attempt to have a male inmate killed?�

Janique�s surprise wasn�t entirely feigned.

�What?� 

�I have it on good authority that you pledged a large sum of money for the murder of Stang inmate Christopher Turner.�

�Chris?� she gasped. �That�s insane, he�s my fianc�.�

�The specifics are of no concern to me. But my source is exceptionally reliable.�

Janique was still reeling from the shock.

�Ms. Patton, you look paler than usual. Is there anything you�d like to discuss?�

She got a hold of herself.

�Your reliable source is lying, or mistaken. I would never kill anyone, much less my future husband.�

�This prison is brimming with women who probably told themselves the same thing at some point in their lives. Of course, none so attractive as yourself. I�m prepared to let bygones be bygone, Ms. Patton. But, as the expression goes, no one rides for free.�

His right hand went under his desk. �I can make your stay here extremely difficult, or extremely easy. The choice is yours, of course.�

�What are you trying to say?�

�I�m saying that if you�re smart, you�ll get under my desk.�

Janique reddened with fury.

�I can get you anything, Ms. Patton. Food, cigarettes. Drugs, perhaps? You won�t have to work in the laundry anymore.�

�I like the laundry. That clean clothes smell. I respectfully decline,� she said, masking her anger as best as she could.

�Then perhaps I�m approaching this all wrong. I could, instead, take your little job away from you. Put you into solitary confinement. Revoke all privileges.�

�Are you threatening me?� she asked.

�Yes, Ms. Patton. I am.�

His eyes met hers, and she saw cold, calculating scorn.

�Then I retract, respectfully,� she said, fully matching his gaze with her own.

�You�re making a serious mistake, Janique,� he said, switching to her first name unexpectedly. �I hope nothing happens to your boyfriend. I�ll check back with you in a week. You�ll come around. Girls like you always do.�

He buzzed the receptionist. �Send a guard,� he said.

To her dismay, it was Amy. Janique studied her face closely, but she gave no indication that she was aware of the current situation.

�Cuff her,� the warden said, still caressing himself through his pants.

Amy turned her around and cuffed her hands behind her back.

�Sorry,� she whispered into Janique�s ear.

�Did you know,� the warden asked, �that the Spanish word for handcuffs is the same as it is for marriage?�

Neither woman was in any mood to respond to his inquiry.

�Take her back to the pod. She has a lot to think about.�

Amy said nothing, but instead led her from the room. When they were past reception and into the corridor, Janique said, �It�s a good thing I�m handcuffed, Amy.�

�Why�s that, Johnny?�

�Because if I wasn�t, I�d probably kill you.�

Amy stopped walking and got in front of Janique.

�What?� she said, genuinely hurt.

�The warden just accused me of putting a hit on someone. Thanks a fucking lot, bitch.�

Amy began to get noticeably nervous.

�Did he mention my name?�

�No, but who else could it be?�

�Oh, I think I know who it was, but I don�t like the implications.�

�Who?�

�The guy I arranged the hit through.�

Janique stared at her as if she were a display in a museum, straining desperately to see if she was telling the truth.

�You believe me, don�t you?�

�I don�t know what to believe, right now. He said I put a hit on Chris.�

�Your boyfriend? That�s crazy. Unless��

�Unless what?�

�Unless Chris killed Jeanette�s nephew.�

�What?�

�You said to hit whoever killed Jeanette�s nephew, so that�s what I told my guy. He wouldn�t do it, by the way. Wouldn�t say why.�

Janique looked somewhat relieved by this news.

�Good. Keep the money, okay? Something still doesn�t make sense though.�

�Does this mean you believe me?�

�I guess it does.�

�The only explanation I can think of is that Chris killed Jeanette�s nephew.�

�Like in a fight? That doesn�t sound like Chris.�

�Prison changes a man, Janique.�

�I know.�

She knew. Because prison changed women, too.

###

The next day found Chris back inside the laundry with a four-man crew. They pulled a quick measurement, and painted an orange stripe across the floor, dividing the laundry in two. From there, they began moving equipment on either side away from the demarcation, creating a channel in which to operate the scissor lift. While his men handled that chore, he pulled a few additional measurements, ultimately painting a door-sized rectangle on a wall. Then he sought out Jeanette�s approval. She was in her office, catching up on paperwork before her workers came in.

�Mrs. Gutierrez?�

�Jes?�

Chris explained what needed to be done that day.

�A hole in thee wall? This is a preeson.�

He unrolled the blueprints and patiently got her oriented. It wasn�t necessary to obtain her permission, but it would make everything much easier if she understood what was going to happen.

�Well, that�s not the outside wall. It opens into a plumbing chase. It�s like a tunnel.�

�A tonal?� Jeanette looked frightened.

�It doesn�t go anywhere. Look.�

He pointed at the rectangular corridor between the walls.

�See? It�s just so we can access the piping for the washers and dryers, electrical lines and stuff. And we�ll build a sturdy, temporary door with a chain and padlock. Okay?�

When Jeanette was satisfied nothing untoward was going to occur, Chris refocused his attention on the visqueen containment wall. He lined everyone out on what they were to do.

�I want one of these two by fours every four feet across the ceiling. When the wood is up, drape the plastic ceiling-to-floor. Don�t leave any gaps, and don�t let it sag. Then we�ll use negative air to keep the dust out of the other side.�

�What�s negative air?� Garcia asked.

�Good question,� Chris said. �Negative air means we increase air pressure on the other side of the barrier, to prevent dust from coming in.�

�How do we do that?�

�Fat Sam is going to reverse the polarity of the wall fans, sucking in air instead of blowing it out.�

�Not a problem,� Sam said.

�Then let�s get it, guys.�

Chris went up on the scissor lift to show his men how he wanted the two by fours attached. But when he got to the ceiling, Janique walked in. Time stood still. He held his breath as he studied her walk, not wanting to forget a single detail about her, preserving the moment for all eternity.

She followed the same route that Paul had mapped out for him, which was good. Right before she turned into the repair room, Janique looked up at the lift and waved to him. His heart leapt into his throat. He enthusiastically returned the gesture and saw her award-winning smile light up her face. Then she was gone. Chris stood dazed, as if someone had awakened him from a dream. Finally, he regained his composure, and ran a few two-bys with the nail gun, until he had enough up to hang a roll of plastic.

When he had stapled the end of the roll across the boards, he brought the lift down, creating the first panel in the temporary wall. It was all he could do to not run to where she was. Janique, so sweet, beautiful, and perfect. He could think of nothing else.

�Do it like that,� he said absentmindedly, and walked away.

Chris spent the next hour framing up a doorway so that when he cut a new access way into the plumbing chase, it wouldn�t take long to seal it back up. Keeping Jeanette placated was also part of his job.

Fat Sam and his helper had already re-wired three of the four fans. When they were turned on, the visqueen billowed outward, indicating dust would flow away from the laundry workers and their clean clothes. The fans on the work side of the plastic continued to blow air out, ensuring that his crew could work in relative safety and comfort.  

As they were connecting the sides to the wall and sealing the gaps with tape, Chris fired up the demo saw. The sound was loud, even in the noisy laundry. But in less than five minutes, he had cut out the entire outline of the door, slicing through cinderblock, mortar, and rebar alike. Finally, he killed it and set it down. With one well-placed kick he sent the entire cut section of wall crashing to the floor. When the dust settled, Chris grabbed a flashlight and stepped into the hidden corridor that ran along the outside wall.

He walked left until he found the back of the dryers, and then scrawled a few notes on the wall. When he made his way back to the temporary door, Chris decided on a whim to investigate further. Around a corner, he found an air intake that looked promising. He pulled another measurement and made a note in the pad he kept in his shirt pocket. Once he left the chase, his suspicions were confirmed. The intake apparently ran into Janique�s repair room. He filed away the info for later.

The containment was fully erected, dividing the female side of the laundry in half. Tomorrow they would begin the demolition of the wall between the two laundromats.

�Looks good, guys,� Chris said. �Tomorrow�s all jackhammers and destruction, so come prepared. I have dust masks, but try and cover your hair, too. The concrete dust is really acidic.�

Fat Sam�s helper was a laborer they had recently nicknamed Abbott, due to the Abbott and Costello effect of working with Fat Sam.

�Abbott, come see,� Chris said.

At the back entrance was a spool of pipe that Tokio and Chainfall had fabricated at Chris�s behest a few days earlier. It was eight-inch pipe about a foot long, with a flange on each end.

�What�s that?� he asked Abbott, pointing at the spool.

Perplexed, Abbott said, �A spool of pipe?� He was careful to use the correct terminology.

�Wrong!� Chris said. �It�s a deadman.�

Abbott was confused, but said no more. Chris rolled the spool onto the laundry floor on the working side of the barricade.

�This spool of pipe,� he began, �is a deadman. You�re going to mount it to the floor right here. When it comes time to move these units, you�ll thank me.�

Abbott didn�t need to be told twice. He walked off to gather the tools and materials he needed to affix it to the floor.

Back in the warehouse, the welding was finished. Paul and Tokio went up to the roof to partake, and water Baby, the female plant they were growing up in the rafters.

�Pour it slower, Toke,� Paul admonished him. �You�ll dig a hole and expose the roots.�

�Who�s fucking this chicken, Chainfall? Me or you?�

He elected not to pursue it, but Toki slowed his pour, just the same. The plant was flourishing in the hot, dry conditions. The branches strained upward to meet the sun, and Paul�s expert care insured it was a showpiece worthy of being a High Times centerfold.

�So, teach me about testing,� Paul asked, instead.

�Can�t, Chainfall,� Tokio said.

�Why not?� 

�Because there are too many kinds of tests. Penetration tests, visual tests, magnetic tests, pneumatic tests. Etcetera,� he said.

�I just mean testing this piping right here,� Paul said.

�This,� Toke said, slapping a piece of pipe that extended through the roof, �is a hydro test. It�s exactly what it sounds like.�

�Water test?�

�Right. Basically, we�re going to close off the pipes and fill them with two hundred pounds of water pressure. I have calibrated gauges and a hydrostatic pump in those boxes right there.�

Tokio finished explaining the process and then they went to work.
20 � The Chase
�Mrs. Gutierrez, may I have a moment?� Chris asked her.
�Jes, of course.�

He brought her outside of the plumbing chase and handed her a hardhat.

�For me?� she asked, slightly surprised.

�I don�t want you to hit your head, it�s dark in there, even with a flashlight,� he told her.

�Oh, okay.�

He led her into the dark and musty corridor, which was crisscrossed with piping and cobwebs. A quick glance back at her confirmed her fear and distaste. At the air intake, he stopped.

�I�ll need to reroute this duct work,� he said, pointing at it with the flashlight. �Is that going to affect your workers?�

�I don�t know,� she said. �It may get hot in the repair room.�

�Oh, this isn�t the air conditioning, it�s just an intake. The temperature won�t change at all. It might be a little noisy when we do it.�

�Okay,� she said. �Thas no prolem.�

�Great,� he told her. �Thanks a lot.� And then he led her back out of the plumbing chase.

Chris could see relief on her face as she blinked under the bright sodium lights of the laundromat. She shuddered and wrapped her arms tightly around herself.

�Scary,� she said. �I don�t want to do that again unless I have too.�

�Don�t worry,� Chris said. �You won�t. This is the door we�re putting up after we haul these blocks away.�

He kicked the door frame he had constructed earlier that day.

�It�ll keep the rats out of the laundry.�

�Rats?� she said. �In here?�

�Oh, didn�t you hear them? I�m surprised. But that�s mostly all that�s back there. And spiders.�

�Spiders?� she asked, alarmed.

�Just your black widows and brown recluses. The other spiders aren�t deadly.�

�Deadly?� she asked.

�Of course, where there are rats there are snakes, right?�

Jeanette turned pale, and Chris thought she might get sick.

�Pleese,� she said, �Close the door soon, okay?� 

Chris was grinning as she walked off. Jeanette spent the rest of her day in her office with her feet on her chair.

But the ruse worked perfectly. She would never want to go into the plumbing chase again. He gathered his men and explained what needed to be done. In a flash, they went to work. One of them cleaned up and began hauling away cinderblock. Two others started to hang the doorframe. The last, he led into the chase. After a few minute�s discussion, they had developed a plan of attack. Chris left him with a flashlight and went back to his blueprints. He drew a small isometric sketch of what he wanted to build, and then made up a list of additional materials he would need for the next phase.

Once the doorframe was in place, everyone joined in on the plumbing chase project, and they were so enthusiastic about it, Chris had to pull them off of it at quitting time.

Back at the warehouse, Tokio was asleep in his chair, a plumbing inspection certification stapled to his shirt. The rest of his crew was sitting in a semicircle shooting the shit. But Chris�s crew couldn�t contain themselves.

�We�re all gonna get laid!� one of them yelled, and an enthusiastic cheer erupted from both groups.

###

When Janique came in the next morning, she may as well have been traipsing through a meadow full of wildflowers as an industrial laundry. It�s hardly fair to the rest of the world, she thought, that I could be so happy in my situation when so many others led better lives and weren�t. She hoped everyone would get to feel what she felt, one day. If not, maybe a trip to jail then, so they could appreciate what they have more. It was Chris�s proximity, of course. The air was electric with anticipation. Janique looked down at her arm and saw the hairs standing on end. He always said her goosebumps were sexy.

She was thinking about her flowers.

She had noticed the previous evening that her roses, after a full week, still hadn�t wilted. At first, she thought it was miraculous, that the room and their love was somehow preserving them forever. But Chris�s voice in her head told her to look deeper. Existence, he used to say, was the real miracle.

She noted that six of the flowers were wilted. The others were in much better shape, yet she�d gotten them all at the same time. The answer came to her with frightening clarity. She could see it in her mind�s eye. Chris was replacing roses every day, creating a perpetual bouquet for her. Her heart fluttered as she walked to the repair room and she scarcely noticed the dryer in her path, half pulled away from the wall at an angle, as she stepped around it.

A hand reached out from behind her as she went by, covering her mouth and dragging her back toward the machines. She tried to scream of course, and her eyes grew wide with fear and shock. She had never been raped before, and Janique had no intention of doing so now. You can�t rape the willing, Chris used to say to her, and then she would punch him in the arm. Somehow, she knew that was what was happening, and began to panic.

She swung her right fist upward over her shoulder, toward her unseen assailant�s face only to find in perfectly countered, her tiny fist caught in a larger one. The hand around her mouth gripped tighter and she could feel the heat coming from between his legs. She then threw her left elbow back into his sternum and was amazed to feel it bounce off again with no harm done. Janique only had one option left, so she brought one foot up behind her as hard as she could and connected solidly with his testicles. 

She squeezed her eyes shut tightly, bracing for a scream, a punch, some sort of negative repercussion for her actions. Instead, lips lightly kissed her cheek. Her eyes popped open as he released her mouth.

�Chris?� she said, way too loudly.

His hand clamped back over her mouth as he spun her around to face him. He pressed down tighter for a second to emphasize the point, and then took his hand off again. Janique flung herself into his arms, wrapping her own around his neck, and began showering him with kisses. Chris held her aloft and backed her against the wall. He thought she might eventually tire of kissing him but she never did. Neither did he, so he was forced to break off from her for a moment.

�Janique, we need to talk,� he whispered. She ignored this and began kissing him again.

He fell back in with her for another minute or so, and then forced himself to stop again.

�Janique, we don�t have a lot of time, and it�s important that we talk.�

�So talk,� she said, getting down on her knees and rubbing his swollen cock through his pants.

Chris suddenly found it difficult to concentrate.

�Uh, I have a plan to see you regularly. It-�

She slid her hands down the back of his pants and then pulled them and his underwear down.

�Go on�� she said, taking him in her mouth.

�Uh,� he said.

She stopped momentarily.

�Plan to see me�� she reminded him.

�Mmm,� he said. 

She bit him lightly.

�We�re building a fake room back here. Access is through the vent on the back wall of your repair room.�

The news excited her, and she transferred her excitement to him.

�Um,� he said. �So, tell your friends, only the ones you can trust. They can definitely party if they want to.�

She stood up and kissed him.

�Okay,� she said lightly.

�I also have a plan to escape. Unless you want to cop a plea and let me take the rap.�

�Ssshhh,� she said. �Never.�

�I�ll let you know more soon, we-�

�Chris, if you don�t make love to me, I�m going to scream. Loudly.�

Checkmate. He turned her to face the wall, and she wriggled out of her jumpsuit. Together they lasted a little over a minute. Janique got dressed, and Chris pulled up his pants.

�Oh, Chris. Hold me,� she said.

He hugged her tightly.

�No, I want to lay by you.�

�Here?� he said.

�Yes, here.�

Again, he had little choice but to oblige her. To his knowledge, Janique always got what she wanted. Chris had lookouts and signals in place. But he didn�t plan on falling asleep.

Ten minutes later, they awoke to the sound of the demo saw.

###

�I have to see her, dude,� Paul said, looking up at Lady Macbeth, his pot plant. 

�We got shit to do, kid,� Tokio told him.

They were waiting on the concrete truck, having come in an hour early for nothing. It was already seven-thirty in the morning.

�Like what?� Paul asked, miffed at the denial.

�Like getting the concrete finishing tools up on the roof,� Tokio said, sipping his coffee.

The coffee pot and the endless supply of coffee was the one benefit no one had considered when they started, but it was second only to the weed and tobacco in popularity. On a brisk fall morning spent on the roof, it was indispensable.

�What are you going to do?�

�Fuck what I�m going to do, Chainfall. An apprentice should never ask his boss that. But if you must know, I have paperwork to attend to.�

He held up two Zig-Zags in an �L� shape, and Paul grinned, then dashed off to make the final preparations for pouring the pads.

Toke meandered up shortly after Paul was done. The rest of the crew was rechecking the placement of the forms while there was still time to move them if necessary. He flashed the spliff, and everyone huddled near the mechanical room out of the wind to smoke. It took so much weed to get everyone high at that point, he had taken to rolling huge cones that burned for ten minutes or so before they became so clogged with resin they would no longer draw.

But they had no sooner reached that point when someone said, �There it is,� and pointed to a tiny blue dot on the horizon.

Chico went down and flagged the driver over to his parking spot. Ordinarily, a finishing crew came with the truck, but Earl managed to save a few thousand dollars by getting the truck and driver alone. The pour went well, however, and by lunchtime everything that could be done on the roof was finished.

Tokio and Paul were the last to go downstairs. He noticed Paul mooning over Lady Macbeth, looking at her through the frosted glass panes.

�Oh, shit, man,� Tokio said. �Go to her.�

�Really?� Paul asked. �Can I?�

�Hey, baby. It�s your lunchtime. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.�

�Huh?�

�Aleister Crowley,� Toke said

Paul still looked confused but nodded his head as if he understood.

�Can I have a joint?� I like to smoke with my girls,� he said.

Tokio rolled his eyes but handed over a bomber that he pulled from a cigarette pack full of pre-rolls.

�Thanks, chief!� Paul told him as he rushed off downstairs to visit his girlfriend.

Ah, to be young and in love, Tokio thought.

The demo saw was the signal that Jeanette was coming. Chris�s eyes snapped open, and he almost jumped up, dropping Janique to the floor. Instead, he gently shook her awake.

�Get up, please,� he said. �Your boss is coming.�

Now it was Janique�s turn to jump. She sprang to her feet and almost rushed into the laundry, where Jeanette would have seen her instantly.

Instead, Chris caught her by the wrist and walked forward to where his lookout could see him. The procedure was worked out in advance. The spotter held up a hand indicating Janique should remain hidden for now. Then he signaled someone Chris couldn�t see, and the demo saw noise ended abruptly. Another of the crew was yelling, �Look out!� and honking the horn of the scissor lift wildly. He was on an intercept course for Jeanette, and his cries caused her to stop in her tracks, although she was in no danger whatsoever.

With Jeanette�s view temporarily obscured, the spotter gave Chris the all-clear sign. He gave Janique a peck on the cheek and said, �Go.� Then he shoved her out of the chase, giving her ass a slap as she passed into the light. She put her head down and made a beeline for the repair room. Chris then stepped out and turned right to run interference on Jeanette until she was safe.

�Hey!� he yelled. �What happened?� he asked no one in particular.

�Sorry, boss. The pedal jammed on me,� the lift driver said.

�Is everyone okay? Miss Jeanette?�

�Jes. I�m okay.�

�Service that machine,� Chris barked and walked over to Jeanette�s side of the scissor lift.

�Are you okay?� Chris asked again.

�Jes, jes, I�m fine.�

�I�ll make sure it doesn�t happen again.�

Jeanette continued her stroll, eventually ending up at the repair room, which was exactly the sort of scenario the lookouts were there to prevent. Luckily, the system worked. Janique was safely back at her station, dutifully mending jumpsuits and prison outfits.

�Yanique!� Jeanette said. 

Janique turned around, fearing the worst. She had no idea if she had been spotted or not.

�I theenk ju are working too hard. Jure all doosty,� Jeanette said.

�Oh,� Janique said. �Some uniforms fell behind the rack over there. I had to crawl back and get them.�

�Okay,� Jeanette said. �Those men will be working on the other side tomorrow. If there is too much hot or noise, let me know.�

�I will, Jeanette. But I doubt they�ll bother me.�

Satisfied that her laundry was running smoothly, Jeanette returned to her desk, where she unthinkingly pulled her legs up onto her chair.

Satisfied, also, that their plan was foolproof, Chris and his crew spent the day hauling in materials for the love nest they were constructing. They did have work to do in the chase, anyway, but no one wanted to work on anything else until the room was constructed. Access was an issue until John the Fisherman, the resident carpentry expert, offered his opinion. Chris had imagined the top row or two of cinderblocks being left out, and a rope ladder of some sort.

John the Fisherman designed a complete, full-sized door. He handed Chris his sketches and material list. 

�If we use three-quarters inch plywood with two by fours backing it, we can shear off the face of a bunch of blocks and mount them on the door. When it�s closed, it�ll just look like a seamless wall.�

�How do we open and close it?� Chris asked.

�Ah, that�s the really elegant part,� John said. �A cabinet latch. Push on the door a tiny bit, and the latch opens. But if you don�t know it�s there��

�Brilliant,� Chris said. �Make it happen.�

Chris gathered his tools and walked into the repair room straight away as if he owned the place. But he ignored Janique, even as she turned to look at his entrance, and instead walked straight to the back wall and began to remove the screws that held the grating in place.

As he worked, he whistled a tune. Chris was a terrible whistler, but there was no mistaking the song. It was Life in the Fast Lane.

Janique swooned.

When he had finished, he left again in the same manner. Soon, she heard him in the plumbing chase, unscrewing, cutting, and hammering the duct work that led into her work area. The tension rendered her unable to think or work, so she stood there numbly staring at the hole he had left in the wall. But after only a few minutes, she heard him whisper her name.

�Stand over here and mess with these racks so I can talk to you,� he said.

She walked over to the repaired uniforms and began to look through them slowly.

�First of all, I love you,� he said.

�I love you!� she said, unable to contain her excitement. If she had a tail, it would have been wagging at that moment. She knew Chris loved her, but Janique longed to hear him say it, and often.

�I love you,� he said again. �We�re going to need some bedding. Sheets, pillows, blankets. Enough to make a bed with.�

�Why not use a mattress?� Janique asked.

�You have mattresses?�

�Sure, they�re stored here. None of that is a problem. We just have to move one without Jeanette finding out. What else?�

�Did you talk to any of your friends, coworkers?�

�Chris! That was fifteen minutes ago. I�ll talk to them today.�

�Okay, great. This will be the entry. We�ll work out a schedule. How long can any of you stay away?�

�Oh, an hour, I think,� Janique said.

�Okay, an hour is good. Maybe with lookouts and planning they can stay longer.�

�Great. How do we pair them up?�

�First come, first served, I say. Or first come, first come, rather. After the initial meetups, I�m sure they�ll have preferences.�

�I�m looking for a tall guy, myself,� she said, smiling.

�Construction worker?� he asked. �I think I have someone who would be perfect for you.�

�Yum!�

With that, he was gone. Janique soon heard his voice from down the chase: �Put the blocks here, and the threading machine to the side.�

The grating remained open, hidden behind the racks of clothes, so she knew he�d be back. After Jeanette made her next predictable visit, Janique went and got a big cup of coffee and loaded it with cream and sugar. She knew that many of the women were on edge due to the male presence, but the laundry was otherwise business as usual, as far as she could tell. She made her way back to the repair room.

Convinced that her brief absence would not be noticed, Janique ducked behind the uniforms and slipped through the opening. Her eyes adjusted rapidly, and she could see the light where they were working from around the corner. The men were so engrossed in what they were doing, she managed to walk right up to them in the darkness. She stood behind Chris and said, �Coffee?�

Chris jumped, startled by the unexpected interloper, and even more startled to hear her voice.

�Janique!� he said spinning around, �What are you doing?�

�Just wanted to say hi,� she said. 

She became aware of five other pair of eyes staring at her. It felt more dangerous than the lion�s den. Janique knew that were it not for Chris�s presence and leadership, they would have taken her there on the spot. It was an idea that both thrilled and horrified her.

�Hello, boys,� she said. �How�s the treehouse?�

Chris accepted the coffee, ever mindful of her feelings, and gave her a kiss that made her knees weak.

�Go,� he said gently. But he walked her back to the repair room.

�We can�t get caught, especially here. It will ruin my escape plan. I love you,� he told her.

�I love you,� she said. He held her for a long minute, and then she kissed him on the cheek before disappearing back into her room for the rest of the day.
21 � The Love Nest
Back on the roof, Tokio�s crew was setting air conditioner units. The pads they poured were larger than they needed to be, so they just positioned them close to the piping, rather than centering them on the pads, saving him the need to do any rework.
Toke had set units with a helicopter before, and as a result, the crew had a great day. The roar of the engine and rotors, the rushing winds, and the danger added greatly to their enjoyment. By lunchtime, the air conditioners were in place. All that remained was to reposition them slightly and make the final bolt-up connections. Fat Sam would run the power, and the group collectively would install the new duct work. Earl had decided against a sheet metal subcontractor, to their dismay.

�A learning experience,� Chris had told them. Sheet metal was the one trade unrepresented in their crew.

�I need a break, chief,� Chainfall said, dancing around on the roof.

�Bathroom?� Tokio asked, stating the obvious. �Ain�t no one got to ask permission to take a piss.�

Paul shook his head.

�No, I have to deliver minerals and nutrients to a client,� he said.

Tokio shook his head sadly. �This better be some bomb-ass weed, kid.�

###

Chris�s crew ended the day having laid out the room and putting all the rebar into holes they had drilled in the floor. John the Fisherman had constructed a fine door and was working with Hiram the mason on the brick detail. 

�How can we hide the edges?� John asked him.

�Eh?� was Hiram�s response. At seventy-four years old he had little use for women, but he was happy to be out of retirement. He hadn�t done construction work since he had retired over a decade earlier, and his fifth DUI offense carried a mandatory five-year sentence.

He knew he would die in prison but felt that the Grand Old Architect of the Universe had placed him here to complete one last mission.

�We have to hide the seams, otherwise we might as well have a sign with an arrow that says �Door��, John was saying.

Hiram was nothing if not a master craftsman.

�Just tell me what you need, sonny.�

John the Fisherman told him his idea, and the two put their heads together. Soon, Hiram was making what appeared to be the tiniest concrete form of all time. It looked like he was building a curb for a tiny model city. He lined the bottom with a strip of angled molding.

�Get me some tie wire,� he said, and John the Fisherman did as he was told.

�Now cut me three pieces, this long,� he said, holding up his hands.

John did so and tried to hand them to him when Hiram said, �Now stretch them.�

�What?�

�No one ever sent you to the toolroom for a pipe stretcher before, when you were green?� Hiram asked.

�I never worked pipe. I got sent for level bubble and skyhooks, things like that.�

�Well, I�ve done it all. I had thirty-two jobs before I did brickwork. And there is such a thing as pipe stretching.�

�Really?�

�Did you see the boilers that got delivered?�

�Sure. They�re huge.�

�They�re going to have three-eights copper tubing coming off of the top of them. Copper tubing is soft and comes in rolls. If you unroll it and try and use a long piece, it will look like hammered dogshit.�

�Okay,� John the Fisherman said, noncommittally.

�If you see them try and run that tubing without stretching it, stop them and do what we do with this wire. Bring them into the laundry,� he said, indicating the pieces of wire.

Hiram grabbed two clamps from a toolbox. In the laundry room, he clamped one end of the wire to a solid piece of bracing, and the other end to a scissor lift.

�Now straighten up the wheels and drive forward,� he said.

Realization dawned on John�s face. Moments later, the wire was almost perfectly straight and more rigid than before. Hiram set it aside and repeated the process twice more.

�You can�t build your house on a bed of sand,� he said somewhat cryptically. But his point was made, regardless. Hiram produced wire cutters from his overalls and cut a few shorter lengths of the wire.

Then he casually sat on the floor and painstakingly began to tie the pieces together into a tiny triangular frame. He said nothing during this process, and John didn�t feel he had the agility to manipulate the wire as deftly as Hiram could, despite his advanced age. When he was done, they carried the wire framework back into the plumbing chase, where it fit perfectly into the form they had constructed earlier.

Hiram eyed the configuration for a moment and then said, �Fetch me a bucket of mortar, boy.�

John the Fisherman was forty-six years old, but Hiram managed to make him feel like an eighteen-year-old greenhorn. 

Things seemed to be going great for everyone. They had just finished pouring the mortar, and Hiram was finishing the surface when Earl walked into the plumbing chase.

�Damn, boys,� he said. The entire crew froze, sure that they were caught. Their visions of hot sex dissipated like smoke. 

�Don�t y�all ever slow down?� he asked them. Several people exhaled and visibly relaxed. Earl had no idea what the job actually entailed and so saw nothing amiss.

Chris was naturally the first to speak up.

�Can�t, boss,� he said. �We gots a laundry to build.�

�Fuck the laundry,� Earl said, pulling out his phone and hitting speed dial.

�Yeah, I need twelve large pizzas and six two-liters of soft drinks. What kind? Gimme a variety pack. Come to the back entrance of the prison. Yeah, the loading dock. I�ll have the guard flag the driver through. I�ve got twenty-dollar tip if you hurry.�

Earl hung up the phone looking pleased with himself. He was looking pretty skinny lately and seemed to have a perpetual case of the sniffles.

�Didn�t Chris tell you boys?� Earl asked. �We reached another milestone. We just made four hundred thousand dollars!�

He was entirely oblivious to the fact that his employees earned exactly nothing for their efforts, aside from sustenance. But Garcia, one of the more savvy of the somewhat na�ve crew said, �How about coming off some of that coke, then?�

Earl looked surprised and then flashed a large smile.

�Well hell, boys. All you had to do was ask.�

By the time the pizzas got there, most of them had no appetite.

###

Chainfall�s plant was thriving, along with Chris�s flowers and rosebushes. Paul had assumed care of them without even being asked, and he was a skilled botanist. When he had finished his conjugal visit, he sought out Tokio.

�Here,� Paul said, holding out his closed hand.

Tokio opened his own hand and Chainfall Paul dropped a few flower tops in his palm. He eyed them speculatively.

�Smell it,� Paul encouraged.

Tokio gave them a sniff. �Smell like spearmint,� he said, finally.

�It�s a hybrid,� Paul said, rather proudly. �It took me three years. I call it Willy Wonka. It has a THC count of eighteen percent. I don�t have the means to test it in here, but I hope to stress the plant into the twenty percent bracket. That would make it the most potent weed on Earth. And the tastiest.�

�Stress it?� Tokio asked.

�THC is an oil that protects the plant from the sun and arid conditions. Keep it hot and thirsty and it will increase THC production.�

�We can see it, now,� Tokio said. �Is it worth getting busted over?�

Paul thought about it.

�If I get caught, I can�t smoke it,� he said.

�Smart dude,� Tokio said.

They ended up wrapping the top of the column in an opaque visqueen, which blended in well enough to fool all but the most observant. Besides, as Paul pointed out, who looks up?

�Say, Chainfall, how�d you get the seeds in here?�

�Brought �em in. I knew I was coming to do three years.�

�How, I said. How?�

�Oh. In my ass.�

�Chainfall, you a nasty mothafucka.�

###

Hiram abstained, but didn�t begrudge the rest of the crew their fun. He was the only person who questioned the strength of the walls.

�Why all this reinforcement?� he asked Chris.

�New specs, some state law got passed. It calls for all walls to be secured with rebar, and filled with concrete, even interior walls.�

�But isn�t this project off the books?�

�Well, yeah, sure,� Chris said. �But I don�t want anyone getting suspicious because we built a wall that wasn�t up to spec. This way I can just claim ignorance and say I thought the prints called for a wall here. The fact that the wall is built correctly helps support that.�

�I see,� Hiram said, only somewhat satisfied with the explanation.

�Oh, that reminds me,� Chris said getting up from his meal. He had quietly abstained from the cocaine along with Hiram.

He came back with a one-inch threaded tee with nipples and caps coming out of each opening.

�Can you stub these out of the exterior wall of the room for me?� he asked. �A gas line has to run through here.�

�Ayuh,� Hiram said. �Show me where you want it, and how it orients.�

�Along the wall,� Chris said gesturing, �About two feet off the floor.�

�And how does it sit?�

�Like this,� Chris said, showing him.

�You want it on the other side of the wall?� Hiram asked, confused.

�No, I want it in the wall,� Chris said.

�Then what is the tee for?� 

�Future expansion,� Chris said coolly.

Hiram accepted both the tee and the explanation without further questions.

###

A week had passed, and Janique found herself summoned from work once again to see the warden. She was ushered into his office straight away.

�Hello, Janique,� he said.

Stony silence was her reply.

�I trust you�ve considered my offer,� he said.

The silence was deafening.

�Have you made a decision?� he asked finally.

�I have,� she said. �And you can go fuck yourself.�

The warden turned purple, but maintained his composure.

�Very well,� he said. �One week in solitary for fighting. Unless you�d like to buy your way out of it. Five hundred would do it. This month.�

Janique spit in his smug face.

He casually pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his face.

�Two weeks,� he said, and buzzed for a guard.

###

The next day found the entire crew reunited at the laundry. They cut blocks and hauled cement by wheelbarrow until two p.m., when Chris went to the intake at the repair room.

�Janique,� he said in a loud whisper. There was no response. He had been so involved in his activities, he failed to notice that she hadn�t come to work that day. He walked around to the front, and it was empty. Worse yet, the lights were off. A mild panic set in. Janique was his only liaison with the female crew of laundry workers. Without her, the room was useless. And Chris had made big promises.

Not the least of which was to Janique herself. He struggled in vain to think of a casual way he might inquire about her whereabouts without drawing suspicion. The repair room was one aspect of the laundry not slated for remodeling, but that didn�t stop him.

�Jeanette?� he asked her.

�Jes, Chrees?�

�Would it be a lot of trouble to do some work in the repair room?�

�Repairs?� she asked. �No problem. That girl is not working for two weeks. Fighting.� She said this last word in a hushed tone.

�So we can work in there?�

�Jes. Let me cover the uniforms so they don�t get doosty.�

�Great. Thanks a lot.�

At lunch, he broke the bad news. There was some grumbling, but everyone agreed that nothing could be done other than wait. There was no way anyone was going to convince even a very horny woman to crawl into a dark tunnel with a bunch of sex-starved prisoners, no matter how swift their tongue. But they persevered, and by the end of the day the walls were erected. All that remained was to hang the door in the morning. As they were leaving, a tall, slender Latina deliberately dropped a folded-up piece of paper on the ground in front of Chris as he passed by.

Since no one seemed to have noticed, he unfolded it and read it on the spot. �What day?�, the note said.

It also had a list of names, times and the men they would each prefer to be with. A few didn�t even care who they were paired with, and one distinctly said �all� instead of �any�. Apparently, Janique had told someone after all, and word had spread fast. The note had been written that day, as it included several men who hadn�t worked in the laundry previously. On his way out, Chris glanced behind him, and for the first time became aware of the numerous pairs of hungry eyes currently transfixed on him and his crew.

Back at the warehouse, he wrote up a new material list for Earl, part of his unplanned revisions to Janique�s room. As usual, Earl accepted it unquestioningly, and said he would have the items soon.
22 � Absence Makes The Heart Grow Fonder
Janique�s next day was insufferably boring for her. In solitary, she had no TV, no dayroom, and obviously no one to talk to. Thankfully, she was able to bring her paperbacks. She finished the first of the two novels she was reading and spent much of the day rereading the book Chris had given her, daydreaming about the two of them in Hawaii. The only interruption in the dull stillness of her internment was a tray of food shoved into a slot in the door three times a day, with juice in the morning, and tea for lunch and dinner. She knew her rights as a prisoner guaranteed her access to her commissary account, but in practice, this was not to be. She didn�t even have junk food as an escape from her doldrums.
Each time she reread a poem, her heart soared, but she would only allow herself to read one with each meal, lest she memorize them all. She knew she wouldn�t be getting any new ones while she was in solitary.

###

The crew channeled their energy and frustration into tackling the biggest part of their job, the removal of the dividing wall between laundries. Everyone had different methods, each more dangerous than the last. Some elected to bust the blocks out with sledgehammers. Others used demo saws. Hiram surprised everyone by busting out a block and attaching a come-a-long to the rebar within. He nodded to Paul, who began to work the lever. Shortly thereafter, an entire section of wall came crashing down.

While the demolition took place, Chris used the resulting chaos to communicate further with Janique�s statuesque co-worker. He dropped her a note:

�Pillows, blankets, mattress.
What�s your name?�

The next time he went into the repair room, there was a stack of clean sheets, blankets and pillows (with pillowcases!) waiting for him. On top of the stack was a scrap of paper held in place with a pin.

�Angel�, it said.

At one point during the day, Jeanette left the laundry to visit the administrative side of the prison.

Like clockwork, four girls walked a queen-sized mattress over by the entrance to the plumbing chase and left it leaning against the wall. Chris wondered why a prison would even have a mattress that size in the first place, but two of his crew quickly brought it into the back room. It filled most of the area they had enclosed with blocks. He shut off the light they had wired up and closed the door.

Hiram�s fake grout did the job perfectly, blending in with the walls so well that anyone would be hard pressed to find the door if they didn�t already know it was there. He touched it and pushed slightly. It opened silently like a secret passage in a Scooby-Doo cartoon and Chris felt like a child again for a moment.

If only Janique were free. He wondered what the story was with her. It didn�t seem likely that she would get in a fight now, and jeopardize seeing him, but perhaps she had no choice, he thought. Near the end of the day, Chris left another note on the ground:

�We start tomorrow.
Who do you want?�

Angel retrieved it and read if in front of him. Then she looked him in the eyes and said silently, �You��

###

Janique had a mystery to ponder, and way too much time on her hands to do so. She read Still Life with Woodpecker backwards and forward, treating each single page, front and back, as an individual story from which Chris could extract a poem. When they were out, she resolved, she would have him write one for each set of pages, nearly one hundred and fifty poems.

But what did the two missing pages say, and why did he keep them? She assumed that they must have something to do with their escape. He loved intrigue.

###

The next day the demolition continued, and Chris arranged four liaisons through Angel. He, Hiram, and a helper were handling the renovation of the repair room, and so were on hand to push the underground railroad along. Tokio, Garcia, Chico, and Fat Sam were the first four, and each came back telling tales as if they�d visited some strange and exotic new land. The first three men were spoken for, but Fat Sam was placed with a squat Latina who had specified �any�. He seemed pleased enough by the experience, and certainly no one complained.

Chris and his helper let Hiram lay out the lines they needed to cut and then they went to work with the demo saw. When they were done, the rudiments of a bay window had been taken out of the wall. His helper was one of his secret weapons, a cabinetmaker. The three of them framed out new cabinets along the underside of the counter, and then they took the measurements for the window and countertop. These were later passed on to Earl, who made the necessary arrangements with outside contractors, never realizing that he was paying to renovate Janique�s work area with his own money.

That day was a rousing success, and they left the laundry early so they could go and drink and smoke on the roof of the warehouse, as was now their habit. The four men who had visited with female prisoners regaled the other men with news of their exploits. 

Finally, it was time to go back to the pod. Everyone except Hiram had a good buzz on, and no one, including the guard, noticed that someone was missing until they got back for the second head count, having foregone the first one entirely.

It was determined that Tokio was missing, and Chris went back with the guard.

###

Tokio sat up with Helena Bonham Carter, Paul�s pot plant, until the coast was clear. Paul was right, who looked up? Because if anyone had been paying attention, they would have noticed the scissor lift extended up into the perlings. Instead, they were focused on the stories the other men told. He had gone first, and then excused himself to the bathroom. When he got back, he went straight up on the lift without anyone noticing. He had barely made it to the plant�s hiding spot when the crew began to move to the outside door.

Perfect, he thought. He waited five minutes before moving on, finishing a longneck and lighting a blunt while he waited. Tokio had put a forty-foot extension ladder on the roof. All he carried were beers, a blunt, and some small bolt cutters. When he was satisfied that they had gone on without him, he began to make his way to the next column, and the side window beyond that led to the lower roof.

It was probably his stubborn refusal to leave his last beer behind that caused him to slip. His wet hand held on with only three fingers, and that wasn�t enough to support his weight. It slipped, which preceded the other hand coming loose by microseconds. The only thought Tokio had time for before he hit the floor was �damn�.

###

By the time Chris reached the warehouse, three more guards had joined the search party, and there was talk of sending the code for an escape attempt over the radio, an action that would have resulted in sirens, dogs, and reprisals. Thankfully, the consensus was that it was mere oversight, largely based on his reassurances. When they reached the warehouse, however, their training kicked in, regardless of his feelings on the matter. Two guards went to the roof, and two went to the outside yard and fence.

It was Chris who found his crumpled body on the warehouse floor.

He crouched down and put his hand near Tokio�s mouth and nose. He was still alive. Gently, Chris shook him slightly with his fingertips.

�Toke,� he practically shouted. Tears began to cloud his vision.

One of Tokio�s eyes opened and Chris heaved a sigh of relief.

�Never� even� dropped� my� beer�� Tokio said, and attempted to smile. He offered Chris the neck of the shattered beer bottle as evidence of his feat.

�What happened?� Chris started to ask. And then he saw the boltcutters sticking out of his coveralls.

�Motherfucker,� he said under his breath. He took them and threw them far from Tokio, and then did the same with the broken glass.

�Sorry, man,� Tokio said without opening his eyes.

�Hey!� Chris shouted. �I found �im!�

He refused to leave Toke�s side and had to yell for another minute before a guard heard him and called for the others over the radio. In a flash of inspiration, Chris had laid an open eight-foot ladder on the ground near his body. As the guards approached at a trot, Chris spied the remnants of a blunt on the ground and had to move to step on it.

�He fell,� he said with no further explanation. Tokio opened one eye slightly, and he thought he saw him try to wink. Then he passed out.

The guards didn�t question the scenario as presented by Chris, even though more trained minds would have wondered what he was doing on an eight-foot ladder in a room with forty-foot ceilings, with nothing he could possibly reach from where he was. The important thing was that it was not treated as an escape attempt, which would have destroyed Chris�s own chance. 

Poor Tokio, he thought. Maybe he could have prevented this by including him in his own getaway plans.

He watched them load him onto a gurney and take him to the infirmary. He was later airlifted to a nearby hospital, and Chris didn�t hear from him again for several weeks. He did learn, however, that Toke had broken his back in the fall and was now paralyzed from the waist down.

###

The mood on the following days was somber. News of Tokio�s status was extremely spotty, but they managed to get updates at least once every twenty-four hours or so via sympathetic guards. Damage to his internal organs meant it was rough going for the first night, but on the next evening they learned he had made it out of intensive care after numerous surgeries.

The work continued, regardless. Without Tokio, Paul took over the leadman position. In less than five days, the massive dividing wall had been completely removed.

Chris, however, took it all rather hard. He withdrew to the sidelines, for the most part, spending all his time remodeling Janique�s room with Hiram and his cabinetmaker. Each time they approached something resembling a finished product, Chris moved the goalposts. As a result, the work expanded to fill the two-week span in which she was confined to solitary.

###

After a week, Janique had two visitors on the same day. The first was the warden. It was lunchtime, and she had set aside her book in anticipation of a tray of lukewarm, overly salted food. Instead, the door opened, and he walked into her cell carrying a covered tray.

�Ms. Patton,� he said in a voice that was both genteel and full of mockery, �How are you? I haven�t seen you in what seems like ages.�

Janique eyed him fixedly and said nothing.

He sat down on her cot and placed the tray between them.

�I trust your accommodations were adequate,� he said, trying to get a reaction out of her.

She saw no need to dignify any of this with a response. The smells emanating from the tray were maddening, and she just wanted him to leave so she could eat.

�Have you reconsidered my rather generous offer, Janique?�

His eyes stared deeply into her own and she grew red with fury and embarrassment.

�No, I haven�t given you another thought,� she said honestly.

A scowl momentarily crossed the warden�s face, disappearing as quickly as it had arrived.

�I take it, then, that you�re quite content to stay where you are?�

She leveled her gaze at him.

�Considering my options,� she said, �this is by far the least objectionable course of action.�

The warden stiffened. �That�s a shame,� he said. �I was so looking forward to getting to know you. I assume, then, that your family will begin regular payments to keep you safe?�

�My family,� Janique said, �only wants to know if you�d rather be arrested for rape or extortion.�

The warden swallowed hard but said nothing.

�Of course, if you�re man enough,� she continued, �you can try and take it now.�

He raised his eyebrow at her.

�That way I can beat your ass with impunity.�

His eyebrow found its seat.

�Because I may or may not kill you, but if I don�t you�re definitely going to the hospital.�

The warden looked stunned.

�Care to try me?� she said.

He saw the steel in her eyes and heard the resolve in her voice, reached for his radio and summoned a guard.

Seconds later, her cell door opened, and the warden practically ran out.

�Bring the tray,� he said over his shoulder, and her meal walked out with them.

###

The same day that Janique met with the warden, the windows and countertops arrived. Her repair room was the site of intense activity, with workman coming and going, and the project slowly came together.

The flow of laundry girls never ceased as well, and Chris was a little surprised at the level of desire there. If ever he had doubts about the biological superiority of females, they were all erased at the laundry. Simply put, the women kicked ass and took names, often leaving the men exhausted. Some of them had taken to covering for each other and trading shifts so they could enjoy a double session. If the lucky man involved wasn�t up to the challenge, they were exchanged for a new one.

The requests began to get more demanding as well. Chris got a note requesting two men, and several more requesting him specifically. One of the more frightening notes again said, �All of you�.

Apparently, Chris�s reticence had upset Angel, who never again made eye contact with him, or partook in the daily festivities. Instead, she remained the courier for the operation, but made her displeasure known through her body language and lack of involvement. Hell hath no fury indeed, he thought. He wandered if he was jeopardizing the operation by not servicing the girl. Still, without express approval from Janique, he would not. 

By the end of the day, the windows were set, and the countertops laid. The transformation was breathtaking. What was once a squalid and dreary work area now gleamed with bright chrome and shiny glass. Chris stood back and admired their handiwork.

�Tomorrow we start the mural,� he said.
23 � No Deal
Janique�s second meeting with the lawyers was as upsetting as the first.
The younger member of her legal team showed up to brief her on the upcoming hearing. He explained their legal strategy, to which she strenuously objected a second time. But it was to no avail. Money talked, and in her case it practically screamed. The trial would proceed without her input, the attorney said. She would never even take the stand.

�We�ll have you out of here in a month,� he said with pride.

�I don�t want out!� she yelled at him. �You�re fired.�

But he was undeterred, and spoke to her in condescending tones designed to placate her.

�You�re too good to be in a place like this, Janique. Things will be different once you�re on the outside.�

She knew it was futile to argue. Her parents would never agree to just leave her in prison, no matter her desire. If she objected too strenuously the lawyers would undoubtedly inform her parents, and who knew how they might react? Janique, knowing them as she did, thought that they might declare her mentally incompetent in order to neutralize her opposition. She was on her own, and no one, not even Chris, could help her with this. 

But she had a few ideas of her own�

###

With the wall demolished and the debris removed, part of the crew took down the visqueen wall while most of the others devoted themselves to the task of moving the massive bank of dryers. Once Chris explained the process to Chainfall, who ran with the concept, leaving him to oversee the last details of the repair room, as well as to facilitate the liaisons that continued daily.

Paul would weld pieces of pipe to the frames of the dryers, which could then be raised by massive house jacks. From there it was a matter of putting rollers under them as someone dragged them across the room with a come-a-long attached to the dead man. He was so enthused after they had moved the first, he went back to Chris in the repair room.

�Man, boss,� he said, �that�s the shit!�

�Archimedes like a motherfucker, eh?�

�Well,� Paul said, �Archimedes mainly concerned himself with levers and water displacement, but I know what you mean. I thought that was going to be much harder.�

�That�s great,� Chris said, already turning back to his work, which seemed to involve scribbling furiously on a yellow legal pad.

�Are you alright, boss?� Paul asked.

�Yeah, I�m�� Chris began. �I�m fine. It�s just hard. I did all of this to see Janique, and she�s not here. It feels weird. Like part of me is missing.�

�She�ll be back soon, chief,� Paul said by way of being encouraging.

�Yeah, I�m sure,� Chris said. �I�m also pretty fucked up about Tokio.�

�Me, too,� Paul admitted.

�I could have prevented it,� Chris told him.

�No,� Paul said. �Toke did that shit alone. Plus, he put us all at risk. Stupid.�

�I guess,� Chris said. �But then again, you�re doing what, a two-year jost, at best? Tokio was looking at thirty. I�m sorry, but thirty years is a life sentence for him. And considering the charges, maybe a death sentence, too.�

Paul pondered this.

�We�re each in this alone, ultimately,� Chris continued. �It might have been a dumb move, but I understand why he did it. And I wouldn�t have told anyone else, either.�

�I hear you,� Paul said. �Say, can I go to the warehouse in the morning? I need to attend to Tiffany Amber-Thiessen.�  The plant�s constantly changing name was a running joke.

�Oh, and how is she lately?�

�She�s great,� Paul said. �She�s pregnant.�

Chris smiled. �We�ll go there first thing, you and me. Okay?�

�I appreciate it, boss.�

�Say, Chainfall. Everyone has been to the love shack but you and me, what gives?�

�It�s just that I don�t- I�m-�

Chris cringed, expecting to hear that his leadman was gay.

�I�m just not interested,� Paul said, finally.

Chris eyed him questioningly. �Are you- Does that mean�?�

�No, I�m not gay,� Paul said defensively. �I�ve considered that. I think I�m more� asexual. I like to get high. That�s my sex.�

�I see,� Chris said, somewhat relieved. �If you change your mind, I have this tall Latina��

Paul blushed and smiled bashfully. �I�ll let you know,� he said.

The next day, Chris had the guards drop his men off at the laundry while he and Paul went to the warehouse. The faint odor of spearmint now infused the air. There were plenty of plants to water, but Paul carried a half-full five-gallon bucket to the roof, first.

While he was waiting for him to return, Chris switched on the crude watering system they had devised, a garden hose with holes poked in it, and took out his battered legal pad, which was decidedly thinner than it had been the day before.

The final version of the poem he had been drafting said:

Under the banyan tree
Your head lay on my chest
Softly
With eyes that are closed
I caress your sunlight-dappled flesh
And think
Under the banyan tree
May I someday be laid to rest

He tried to sketch out a banyan tree as well and decided that he would be better off describing it to his artist and letting him work out the overall look of the piece.

Paul was back downstairs in a matter of minutes.

�I think she�s developing a drinking problem,� he said in mock seriousness.

�Ready to go?� Chris asked.

�Come on. I haven�t even spoken to them, yet.� Paul walked down the row of roses and other flowers he had helped to cultivate. �Morning, ladies,� he said, nodding to them as he passed by.

He took the lift up, without the safety harness that would have saved Tokio, and slipped into the screen that held his plant, as gingerly as any man slipping into the shower with a woman.

That boy has problems, Chris thought. Then again, plants were probably better companions than either animals or people, when you got down to it. He imagined Paul caressing his plant�s leaves and whispering in her ear, and he was entirely correct.

After an endless ten minutes, Paul said his goodbyes and descended to find an impatient Chris, who had loaded a pallet jack with an assortment of flowers.

�Ready,� Chris said. This time it wasn�t a question. Chainfall nodded and pulled the cart with a faraway look in his eyes.

Back at the laundry, Chris had ordered the sewing room covered up until it was time for the unveiling. His artist ordinarily worked concrete and drywall, and was conveniently named Pablo. He had already whitewashed the largest wall and was waiting on the design.

He understood Chris wanted a tree and a poem, but that was all he knew. Chris tried again in vain to draw a banyan tree for him, but the best he could manage looked like an octopus on stilts. Pablo had to rely on description alone. Luckily, he was both smart and educated.

�It sounds a little like a mangrove tree, but bigger and denser,� he said, after some consideration.

�Yes, good!� Chris said excitedly. �But it doesn�t grow in water.�

�Okay,� he said with a casual, easygoing confidence.

�Here�s the poem,� Chris said, handing him the final draft.

Pablo read it carefully.

�This is good,� he said. �A little dark, but not morbidly so. Sweet. You must really love her a lot, mang.�

Chris nodded slightly in silence.

�Can you do it?� he asked.

�Two days,� Pablo said, already thinking about the piece in depth.

Chris recognized the look and left him alone in the enshrouded repair room.

###

Janique found herself dreaming about the circus again. It was the worst sort of helpless dream where you stare on in horror, unable to look away. The big top was on fire. Elephants were trumpeting. Great telephone poles supporting the flaming tent were toppling to the ground, bringing sheets of flame with them. She saw a scared little girl, frantically scrabbling with an overloaded keyring in an attempt to free a cage full of big cats.

Janique felt panic, but not for herself. She didn�t get the feeling that the girl was her. But she was in serious trouble. Before she could free the last pair of lions, the largest part of the tent came down like a stone dropping out of the sky. Her last realization was that she and Chris were the lions, and that was to be their fate.

Janique awoke with a gasp on her lips, wanting to cry out in alarm. Barely maintaining her composure, she sat up in the moonlit darkness and pulled her blankets tight around her. What did it mean? She got the uneasy sensation that it was going to happen to them, somehow. Time had started to lose meaning to her in solitary. She slept, ate, and read at odd intervals. It was over an hour before she could sleep again, as she contemplated her dream.

###

The crew returned to the pod that evening to find a sullen and dour Tokio watching TV from a wheelchair. While he was not in the best of moods, it was still a somewhat joyous reunion. After all, he could have been killed. Only Paul and Chris knew about the escape attempt.

After a few uncomfortable minutes, most of Tokio�s coworkers drifted off to attend to their evening rituals. Chris had pulled up a chair, and the two were engaged in a conversation in low tones.

�-upper lumbar region, some vertebrae,� Tokio was saying, and Chris was nodding silently. �Probably up to a million for the surgeries, they said, but it�s repairable for the first two years. After that, it�s fused, calling for an entirely different set of surgeries.�

�So, are they going to do it?� Chris asked earnestly.

Tokio laughed. �No, man. It ain�t exactly covered under the prison healthcare plan. What�s fucked up is I got the money. I just can�t get to it.�

�If I get out before then,� Chris said, �I�ll get you the operations.�

�How?�

�Well, with the money,� Chris said.

Tokio laughed a sad laugh again. 

�Turn over my last little million plus to you? I�m tempted to give it to you just because that is a pure player move, tryin� to jack me like that.�

�I�m not trying to jack you, Toke. I can turn it into more money, get you the surgery, and see about getting your case retried.�

�Turn it into more money? How do you plan on doing that?�

�I have some ideas,� Chris said. �Ultimate hustle��

�Ultimate hustle is bullshit. Look where it got me.�

�It�s what�s going to get you out. Keep the money. I�ll still come back for you, Toke.�

�You sound like you�re leaving next week,� Tokio said.

Chris raised his eyebrow.

�You motherfucker!� 

�You should have talked to me,� Chris said. �We could have combined our efforts.�

�Or you should have talked to me,� was Tokio�s reply.

�I wasn�t the one playing Tarzan.�

�Yeah, I know, man. It�s just� I�m fuckin� crippled, man. It�s fucked up. I�m gonna die in here.�

�No, you�re not,� Chris reassured him before excusing himself to his bunk before showering. But while pretending to be going through his toiletries, Chris pinched off a tiny sliver of tar and brought it to Tokio.

�Eat this,� he said, placing the crescent-shaped slice of heroin in his palm. Tokio, being more than a little familiar with the west coast tar back in the days, didn�t hesitate.

�Ain�t got to tell me twice,� he said.

Chris returned from the shower to find him asleep in front of the TV. Onscreen, Charles Bronson blew away bad guys with impunity. But he knew Tokio was dreaming of other things.

###

Janique dozed on and off throughout the day, seeking neither dreams nor consciousness. Somewhere around the sixth or seventh day, she lost count and gave up on worrying about it, instead taking things one day at a time.

When she was awake, generally after her modest meals were delivered and either consumed or tucked away for later, there were always jailhouse engineering problems to solve. Her first night in solitary was one of complete deprivation. She had no pillow or blanket, just a shoddy green vinyl mattress covered with gray duct tape. It looked hand-selected for its poor condition. The cell was freezing. The thin prison clothes were threadbare and weren�t designed to provide warmth even when they were new. 

The only tools at her disposal were a paper drinking cup and toilet paper, the latter a partial roll she snuck back from the first of her thrice-weekly showers. She hadn�t even been able to shave her legs, and it was driving her crazy.

Janique studied the situation a bit. The air register, some fourteen feet overhead, poured out a continuous stream of cold air. The only other objects in the room were a stainless-steel toilet and sink combo, a towel, and a polished metal mirror. She wet clumps of toilet paper and threw them upward toward the air vent. One or two shots flew wide, but her aim was mostly true, and she managed to cover the entire grill with a little left to spare. Then she used the cup to drain the toilet bowl. She hated to lose it, but her comfort was more important to her than her convenience at that point. She used it to refill the toilet bowl with hot water, and covered it with a towel, and then filled the sink as well. 

Janique stood by the radiant heater she had devised and let a little of the chill escape her bones. Satisfied now that she could sleep, she pulled back a strip of tape, ripped open the mattress covering, and climbed inside of it like a sleeping bag. Not bad, she thought as she began to doze. 

To their consternation, the next morning the guards found her more comfortable and refreshed than they themselves were.
24 � Under the Banyan Tree
Tokio�s presence in the pod affected the mood of the next workday in unexpected ways. Everyone moved a little slower and considered their actions more. Not out of any sense of caution, but rather an unspoken desire to live life to the fullest.
The repositioning of the washers and dryers was scheduled to be completed that day, and the job felt like it was coming to a close. The gas, water, and exhaust vent tie-ins would be a snap due to the work they had done beforehand.

The ductwork would conceivably take another month or two due to their lack of experience in that area, but Chris didn�t think he could make it that long. Janique�s prolonged absence from the laundry was affecting him worse than being sent to jail had. Like the rest of his crew, he had come to realize how precious each moment of life really was. He was determined not to waste any more of it.

The repair room was still covered with visqueen and painter�s dropcloth, but the work was essentially finished. Pablo continued to touch up and add to the mural, and it had already exceeded Chris�s expectations. At his request, he added a small pink butterfly sitting on a mushroom and a flock of birds that were too small to make out, but which Chris said were whooping cranes.

Near the end of the day, with nothing more to be done with the mural, Pablo stood back and asked him, �What do you think?�

Chris didn�t have to think about it. 

�I think it�s perfect, Pab. I love it.�

�There�s a few more things I think I would have done if I had more colors and different kinds of brushes, but I like it,� Pablo said. 

�Is there anything you want?� Chris asked him.

�It�s art. It�s not about things,� Pablo said. �I hope your lady likes it. But even if she doesn�t��

�I hear you,� Chris said. �But I know she�ll love it. She comes back tomorrow, I think.�

Satisfied with his answer, and accepting his praise as payment, Pablo put his signature in the lower right corner then handed the brush to Chris.

�Sign it,� he said. �You wrote the poem.�

He considered it for a moment, then stooped and wrote �All Yours Forever, Christopher Jacob Turner�.

�Good,� Pablo said simply, and began packing up his gear.

Chris stood and stared at the painting a while longer. If he squinted and followed the flock of birds, they appeared to be flying over the Hawaiian sands.

###

Janique�s internal alarm clock got her up early on the day of her hearing. It was also her last day of solitary, but she was unaware of that. It was silly to get up so soon, she concluded, but she did so anyway. She took a bath in the sink and made herself as presentable as she could, given the circumstances. The one concession to vanity her jailers allowed her was a hair band which they had eventually concluded, after much debate, posed no threat of aiding a suicide.

She eyed her hair in the mirror. Luckily, she had been given shower time the day before. Janique wet it and ran her fingers through it, pulling it back tightly with the band. She wasn�t particularly thrilled with the results but managed to look presentable. Her natural beauty went a long way, also. Even without proper hair, makeup, or clothes, she was still the prettiest girl in any room. Shortly after nine a.m., a guard came for her.

Chris, lacking any foreknowledge, was told that he wasn�t going to work that day, but not the reason why. He was frantic, as Janique was scheduled to return to the laundry and he wanted to be there at the unveiling. When the guard finally arrived for him, he was relieved. He�d get to see her in court, although he didn�t think he�d get to communicate with her directly.

He rode a bus with other inmates to the courthouse but there were no women on it, of course. They would arrive separately, and Janique actually got to ride in the Town Car of her defense team, without handcuffs.

On the drive over, she remembered how her life was before Chris. She had occupied the very lap of luxury. Aside from the small matter of having a token job, her formative years were extremely pampered and sheltered. It was easy to imagine falling back into that lifestyle again. A waiting limo driver around the clock, unlimited airfare around the world, and an endless expense account were just a few perks she had enjoyed.

Even at her very affluent high school, Janique was the only one of her peers that had traveled the globe, and she had done it before she had turned sixteen. She had a masseuse, a personal trainer, and even a dietician. With Chris, her healthcare plan somehow consisted of a bottle of aspirin and some antibacterial ointment. Nevertheless, she wouldn�t go back for anything. He had brought real love and passion to her life, and she could no longer imagine living without him. Someday, she thought, we�ll get out and settle down somewhere. 

The courtroom was a world away. Janique was on the beach in Maui outside the Lahaina grill, waiting for her man to arrive.

###

Chris was brought to a cinderblock holding cell to sit on a cinderblock bench. Between being in prison and demoing a huge block wall, he was growing tired of that style of architecture. On the bench alongside him were eleven other inmates from various pods, none from his own. Each of them had their legs shackled to heavy iron rings in the floor. It felt to Chris a little like how he imagined being on a slave ship must have been.

None of the other prisoners seemed very optimistic about their chances in court, judging by their expressions, which ran the gamut of negative emotions. He registered angry, taciturn, hangdog, and morose before setting back against the wall and closing his eyes. But Chris wasn�t in Hawaii. Even now, he was running through his plans, examining each aspect of it in detail. Far from fantasizing about his success, he considered the worst-case scenario at every juncture. The one question he couldn�t answer was �When?�. But he knew the time was drawing near.

He decided to play it by ear and see how things went in court before making any decisions. If the process gave him more time to prepare, he would take advantage of it. He was most concerned about the door to the love nest. It was the weakest part of the plan, he felt, but there didn�t seem to be anything more he could do about it now. In his head, Chris began assembling the components that he had fabricated earlier that week. It would only take an hour or less to get everything in place, he estimated. He was still deep in thought when they called him for court.

###

Janique sat on an antique upholstered sofa in the judge�s chambers, sipping a Coke. No shackles for her, she wore street clothes that her parents had sent with the lawyers, although it was troubling to her that they didn�t attend. She felt a little out of place in her striped Lee jeans and Girbaud shirt, which were holdovers from high school. They did fit well, but the passing years had rendered them a bit out of date. All I need now is a Member�s Only jacket, she thought.

There was a silent agreement between Janique and her legal team. They wouldn�t talk to her about the case, and she wouldn�t shatter their illusions about their chances of winning. Previous discussions regarding their legal strategy were met with stony silence or vituperative outbursts of castigation. Since then, they largely kept to themselves.

Lawyers are an odd bunch, she thought. When children looked at her, they saw a warm, loving mother figure. Men saw a sultry, smoldering sexpot. Women saw a friend or a rival, if not a potential lover. 

Lawyers saw dollar signs.

Janique watched the judge finish his scotch. He had offered her a glass, but she never drank whiskey before noon, and never with a judge, so he rose to begin his workday.

�Let�s do this thing,� he said to no one in particular.

She peeked through the door as he exited his chambers, but the courtroom was too big for her to see everyone through the opening, and she had to restrain herself from running to it to look for Chris. Janique had only assumed he would be there, and hadn�t asked. She didn�t want them to know how anxious she was to see him, lest they find a way to use her love against them both and somehow deny her the chance.

Her mind kept returning to a favorite story from junior high school and beyond, Romeo and Juliet. As an adolescent, she had always dreamed of being so in love that she would die rather than live without her Romeo. Now she had what she wished for, and it was nearly unbearable. Only the promise of being reunited sustained her hope. 

A plan formed in her mind. If her parents were going to buy her freedom and absolve her of past crimes, then she would simply have to commit new ones.

###

Chris filed into the courtroom amidst the others, their attire and appearance highly prejudicial. They looked like felons, were dressed like it, and acted like it. The shackles and handcuffs contributed greatly to the overall effect. Only he kept his back straight and his head held high. As the judge began the laborious task of clearing his docket, Chris realized that Janique probably wouldn�t enter until the case was called, unless she somehow didn�t show up at all.

There was a clutch of female prisoners seated at the opposite end of the courtroom, but she wasn�t among them, and Chris began to lose hope. Without her, there was no place for him on this Earth. Escaping without Janique would by a Pyrrhic victory, at best.

The other cases were the usual hard luck stories, seventy percent of which were drug charges. Chris knew from experience that a woman was at the center of most of them. Then he realized he was no different. Well, he was different, and so was she. But the outcome was the same, regardless.

The judge showed little mercy on the defendants who were ahead of him. Eventually there were only three cases left and he surmised that his hearing would be held last. It made sense, given the nature of the case. Almost everyone ahead of him pled guilty so this was merely a sentencing for them. He and Janique�s trial could conceivably drag on for months. 

His observation of his lawyer�s performance in court only confirmed what he already believed. Public defenders were worse than no lawyer at all. A man who is his own lawyer may have a fool for a client, he thought, but better a fool than a fawning, servile tool of the prosecution.

He eventually started to nod off and had to force his head aloft before the judge noticed. They seemed to take great offense at otherwise minor infractions such as failing to rise in their presence. Chris had always imagined that individuals with that much power would be more forgiving. Instead, they seemed to be the most insecure and petty people on the planet.

At long last, Janique entered the room. Her beauty illuminated it like floodlights, and Chris wasn�t the only person who noticed. Only her defense lawyers seemed unmoved. In what seemed to be a deliberate act, she was seated at the opposite end of the tables from where he and his lawyer had been placed. Three people were between the two of them, and there didn�t seem to be anything he could do about it.

They mouthed a few I love yous and never really took their eyes off each other, but that was all they could do. At one point, he passed a note down toward her as a test. It made it past his attorney and the younger of Janique�s, but the female partner pocketed it without reading it. The older lawyer leaned over and whispered into her ear, who in turn whispered into his attorney�s.

Chris�s defender leaned over and said, �He says to tell you that federal law prohibits communication between felons, and he�ll thank you to not prejudice the judge against his client.�

So much for innocent until proven guilty. At least the note didn�t say anything incriminating, Chris thought. He still had the two pages from her book that he planned to use for covert communication with her, if the need arose. It definitely would if she wasn�t released from solitary soon.

All three lawyers and the judge occupied themselves with procedural issues until Chris heard the judge say, �-and we�ll reconvene tomorrow afternoon at one p.m.�

Janique and her legal team remained seated, but he was ushered out of the courtroom almost immediately. Her eyes held his gaze, but there was nothing they could do but wave goodbye, consoled at least by the fact that they would see each other again the next day.

As Chris exited, two rather burly female guards walked in to retrieve Janique. This time, one of them was the guard that had forced her to undergo the humiliating strip search. A plan began to form in her mind. Unlike him, hers was to stay in prison, having no knowledge of any solid escape plan other than what she considered wishful thinking on her part.

###

Back at the pod, there was little for Chris to do but wait. He considered drafting Janique�s final two poems, but decided that he probably wouldn�t need them now that they were regularly in close contact with each other. Assuming they released her from solitary confinement like they were supposed to. He took his stash of heroin, which was considerable, and flattened it further between two books so he could smuggle it out to the warehouse in the morning. Then he ran through his escape plan over and over again until he fell asleep.

The last thought in his mind as he drifted off was of her.

###

Janique was extremely happy to be out of solitary. For one thing, it proved to be an excellent place to quit smoking. She had let Angel have her packs in the interim, and Janique now found that the smell alone nauseated her. A minor victory for the penal system, she supposed. All the girls swarmed her, glad to see her back. They kept her occupied until bedtime. She was settling into her bunk when Mica held up the replica.

�Did you miss us?� she asked.

�Mica, I think I get the real thing tomorrow.�

She raised her eyebrows. �Good luck,� she said, feeling a trifle disappointed.

Janique�s mind was set on seeing Chris, and she was oblivious to Mica�s mood. The past two weeks of waiting were harder than the previous six months put together. Her last conscious thought was of him.

###

Their first waking thoughts were also of each other. Chris�s eyes snapped open nearly an hour before the breakfast call. Janique could scarcely remember sleeping at all.

He managed to reach the laundry forty-five minutes ahead of the staff, and his crew moved fast. Inside the repair center, every inch of counter, floor, and glass were polished until the entire room looked like the kitchen from the scrubbing bubbles commercial. The fact that the uniforms were now stored in hampers or in overhead cabinets and had been replaced by two caf�-style tables added to the overall effect. There was even a coffeemaker and microwave, of brands not found at Wal-Mart or Target. Hanging under one cabinet at the main workstation was a Bose Wave radio like the one they had at the apartment.

The mural had been sealed with clearcoat and appeared slick without having a lot of glare. Pin spots illuminated it from three directions. All in all, it was as unlike a prison as a place could be. Chris couldn�t imagine a nicer or more beautiful laundry room. It even smelled like fresh clean clothes. He shut off the pin spots and the can lighting that illuminated the countertops and stood outside to wait for Janique. 

He was still apprehensive, unsure if she would be returning or not. As if on cue, the laundry workers began filing into the room, and she was leading the procession, obviously as anxious to see him as he was to see her. Jeanette was bringing up the rear, as usual, and he motioned her over to the repair room, which was now also a breakroom. The rest of the girls followed her and Janique over, more than a little curious after a week of intensive construction and renovation.

The laundry itself was now vast and cavernous. It was hard to believe that three weeks earlier it was half that size. The crowd gathered in front of Chris, who stood before the canvas tarp. He was unprepared for pomp and circumstance, but managed to inject a little showmanship into the proceedings, nevertheless.

�On behalf of the citizens of this fine state, within and without, we offer our appreciation and present you, our institutional laundresses, with this small token of our undying affection. Therefore, without further ado, I present to you the Earl Warren Industrial Laundry and Snack Bar!�

As he said this, he gave a little flourish and pulled the rope that released the tarp.

�Oohs� and �aahs� escaped the lips of the assembled crowd, as the falling canvas revealed a wealth of roses and other flowers growing in planters built into the walls and countertops. Chris fell into tour guide mode and began rattling off items of note. 

�The countertops are Italian granite, and the cabinets are teakwood. Both should withstand a lot of abuse. These are antique tea roses, each more than thirty years old. Paul here can teach a few of you how to care for them. The can lighting uses special grow bulbs, but we went ahead and stocked twenty replacements. And as for the salad bar, well, breakfast is served��

With that, he opened the door, and the smell of coffee and doughnuts made mouths water.

�Of course, the food will ordinarily come from the kitchen, but we felt a small celebration was in order. There is a supply of coffee stuff on hand, though. Miss Jeanette, can everyone have doughnuts?� Chris asked respectfully.

Jeanette was entranced. �Of course, of course. All thees for us?� 

It was Janique who broke the silence as everyone fixed cups of coffee and munched doughnuts. �What about the mural?� she asked him pointedly. It was conspicuously not mentioned by Chris during his presentation.

�I�m glad you asked. This is a mural by our artist-in-residence, three to five, Pablo. It�s called �Superlove�, and to me, it represents the best things in life: love, hope, friends, and freedom. The tree, as a symbol of life, is a banyan tree, native to Hawaii and other places. Let if be your inspiration while you�re in here. We really do appreciate your efforts.�

He received a round of applause, and he could see a tear forming under one of Janique�s eyes. Only she and Pablo knew the real meaning behind the painting.
25 � Memorial to Mr. Earl
Chris had dedicated the breakroom to Earl, complete with a bronze plaque, because he had unknowingly paid twenty-four thousand dollars of his own money to renovate Janique�s workspace. Early on, he had convinced him that he needed a computer and printer. After that, it was easy to produce documents in order to justify practically any expenditure.
Once the excitement had diminished, and the crowd had dispersed, the traffic to the love nest was resumed with renewed interest. The excitement and grandeur of the changes Chris had brought about left both the men and women invigorated and randy. Angel dropped off the schedule for the day as she had been doing since Janique went to lockdown, but everything needed rearranging due to their return to court later that day. And that was a shame because they had a full roster planned.

Chris wrote a revised schedule that placed him and Janique together from eleven to twelve, and he planned to shut things down after that. He would simply tell his men that they might have a rat on the female side, that they were being watched, and needed to lay low for a while. A plausible scenario, he felt. He lined his men out with what was essentially busywork in order to facilitate the last few encounters of the day, and then ducked off to the left end of the chase in order to go over his sketches and material list yet again.

When eleven o�clock was rapidly approaching, both Chris and Janique attempted to freshen up as well as circumstances allowed. At around ten �til, he made a deliberate pass in front of the now immaculate breakroom where Janique worked from her new Herman Miller chair, adjusted to reach the high workstation countertops. Their eyes met, and the electricity could have powered the laundry, if not the surrounding town. 

�I love you,� they both simultaneously mouthed to each other as he sauntered by to wait for the last lucky couple to exit.

###

There was a procedure for leaving the love nest, and it was strictly adhered to. Laundry workers always went out first, and the couples never exited at the same time. Chris spied Pablo exiting the temporary door and knew it was all clear. He walked down the chase to the breakroom to wait for Janique. Time was an imprecise thing in prison. What few watches and clocks could be found weren�t in agreement. Chris didn�t worry when she was two or three minutes behind him.

The fact was, Jeanette had lingered on the floor for longer than usual before retiring to her office for lunch. As soon as she saw her turn to leave, Janique opened the hinged grating and crawled through, as so many of her coworkers had done before her. Chris was there to help her to her feet. She threw herself around him in the dim light, and he squeezed her as he lifted her off the ground. Her back gave a series of pops and cracks, and much of her tension ebbed away. She was in his arms again.

They kissed passionately for a couple of minutes and then Chris said, �We only have an hour,� and led her by the hand away from the love nest.

�Put these on,� he said, handing her a pair of gloves.

�Is this like when I was your helper?� she asked, flashing a grin.

�Yes,� he said. He put on his own. �Follow me, but watch your step.�

He lit the way with his flashlight, and led her to a stack of pipes, boxes, and tools.

�This is the make-out room?� she asked.

�We need to hurry and bring all this stuff there,� he said.

�What is it?�

�A bomb.�

###

Janique began to realize that there would be precious little making out in the make-out room that day. In fact, it looked like they�d be running screwpipe. After they�d toted most of the boxes, and Chris went to work sorting out the materials, she went back for the tools. That alone took two trips. She was starting to get a little frustrated with him, bomb or not.

Rather than stand around and wait, she asked him, �Now what?�

�I�ll be right back,� he said, and darted off down the chase. He quickly returned with a big cylinder with holes in it. It tapered at one end, and the other was round.

Chris started to tell her about the design when he realized he�d been neglecting her.

�Come here,� he said, and she did. She squeezed him so hard he winced.

�I love you!� she said.

�I know,� he said, never loosening his grip. �I love you, too. But I have to get us out of here. We,� he said with emphasis, �have to get us out of here.�

With that, he squeezed her bottom, kissed the tip of her nose, and went back to work. He shone the light on the tee that Hiram had stubbed out.

�We remove that plug, and run this pipe over to there,� he said, pointing at the wall. �The cylinder fills with gas, the room fills with gas, and all we have to do is ignite it.�

�But that�s crazy,� she said. �An explosion in the middle of the day, that�s your escape plan?�

�Let me worry about the rest,� he said. �We have pipe to run.�

Janique knew the mindset, because she had worked with him before, and shared his attitude. Get the bulk of the work out of the way, and then worry about the details. And once Chris had a project, he would attack it until it was completed. She grabbed a wrench and went to remove the plug.

�It�s hand-tight,� he said. �Valved off up the chase.�

�Are you locked out?� she asked in a kidding manner. Locking out meant a padlock on the valve so no one could turn on the gas while they were working on the line.

�Uh, we take certain shortcuts around here. You�re reasonably safe, don�t worry.�

She doped fittings and handed them to him as he put them together. �What happened to �three threads�,� she asked, holding the flashlight as he hand-assembled the pipe without wrenches. �It�s gonna leak.�

�We want it to leak. I mean, at the very least, we don�t care.�

�If you say so,� she said. 

When they had run the pipe to the cylinder, it made a lot more sense to her. There was a set of legs with holes in them in order to mount it.

�But wait, there�s more,� Chris said.

He pulled down a floral-patterned sheet that had served as wallpaper and revealed a honeycomb of holes drilled into the wall. Janique ran the anchors in while he held up the canister, and then it really made sense to her. The gas would fill the cylinders, the holes in the wall, and then the room. It would almost have to blow outward.

As if he was reading her mind, Chris said, �Yep, they let us drill right into the exterior wall. Can you believe it? There�s probably a half-inch of concrete between us and freedom.� She smiled at him. 

Janique shone the light around the room, and for the first time, noticed how cozy it was. The mattress was freshly made, and Pablo�s sheets were in a garbage bag by the door. Candles, now extinguished, lined the room, and their scent still filled the air.

She knew how much Chris loved her, or thought she did, but the magnitude of what he�d been doing really began to strike her. He was attaching the last stick of pipe and connecting the union that closed the line. 

�Stay here and wait on the gas,� he said, and left the room.

Soon, she heard the hissing that signaled the flow of gas, and then began to smell it. A tiny part of her panicked, or at least a tiny part of her planned to panic soon. But the gas stopped as quickly as it had started, with no negative repercussions.

Chris walked back into the room.

�I was going to ask if we had flow, but I can smell it. Now take off your clothes.�

Janique was totally thrown off by the two statements together, but it only took a second for it to sink in before she was giggling and peeling off her jumpsuit with wild abandon. When her t-shirt was being pulled up over her head, Chris rushed in and grabbed her, holding her waist with one hand while the other grabbed her wrists. His mouth was on hers in an instant, and she was in ecstasy. Women could never make her feel this way, she thought. Something about male aggression just pushed all of her buttons at once. Combine that with their love, and well, it�s a good thing there was no gas leak. She would have gladly died in there with him.

After her third second, Chris sat up.

�Time for you to go,� he said.

She squeezed him so hard, he wasn�t sure he could get away if he tried.

�Let them come for us,� she said. �I don�t care.�

�If that happens, we�ll never get out of here, or see each other again,� he told her.

Reluctantly, she relinquished her grip on him.

�I�ll see you in an hour, beautiful. We�ll talk again tomorrow and then we leave. Okay?�

Looking at it that way, it was easier for Janique to walk away. She got about five feet from him before she turned and ran back. She covered his face and neck in kisses, and then kissed his mouth hard again for good measure.

�See you soon,� she said as she walked out the door.

Chris waited a ten count, and then leapt into action. He uncoiled a bundle of wires and mounted the igniter on one end of the wall in front of the canister. The other end was wired to an egg timer. He turned the dial to one minute and watched it give a tiny spark. That spark was his only chance of escape. He had tested and retested it until he began to worry that he had tried it too many times, and that the flint would soon be exhausted. Then he tested it again to make sure it still worked.

Satisfied that the igniter would function as planned, Chris left the love nest and broke the news to his crew that activities would be suspended for a few days. There were a few grumbles of protest, but no one questioned his orders. He made it to the door just as the guards came to retrieve him. 

The trip to court was routine, and when it reconvened a few minutes after one o�clock, things seemed normal there as well. Janique was present, and she was aglow. He could feel the warmth coming off of her from across the room. He smiled, she smiled, and things took on a homey, familiar quality.

It was all shattered when they heard the judge slam down the gavel and say, �The charges against the defendant Janique Patton are hereby dismissed.�

###

Chris was stunned. This turn of events was entirely unforeseen. Dismissed! It was difficult to comprehend. Of all the scenarios he had envisioned and endlessly replayed in his head, this was never one of them. Janique, however, had plenty of forewarning, as well as time to think about what to do next.

The proceedings continued, now focused solely on Chris. The railroading had begun. He shot several sideways glances at Janique, but she stared straight ahead impassively, and he knew she was planning something. Something he probably wouldn�t approve of. He didn�t think she would be released right away. In fact, he knew these things took days or even weeks to occur, ordinarily. But he didn�t know if she knew that. Eventually, the guards came to retrieve her, and Chris braced himself.

It happened when they were cuffing her to return her to the pod, or possibly the laundry. She faced away from them in the main aisle of the courtroom. Perhaps Janique was unsure if she was going to do it or not, but the guard�s actions definitely spurred her into motion. After the cuffs were on, too tightly of course, the guard who had previously accosted Janique grabbed her upper arm tightly and said under her breath, �Let�s go, bitch.�

Janique whirled around and delivered a perfect roundhouse kick to the guard�s face with her left foot. Chris heard her jaw break, and her teeth scattered around the room like loose change. It was a serious felony, and he wondered if the woman would need reconstructive surgery. At any rate, it was extremely unlikely that she would be released now. At their discretion, the prison administrators could sentence you to up to two additional years for battery, and the process was extrajudicial, needing no judge�s approval.

Even her parent�s money wouldn�t help her now, he thought. Chris knew her reasoning, and it was touching, but he wished that she had just accepted her release. That way he could have escaped on his own and then come for her. Instead, he would have to break her out twice, once from solitary, and then again from the prison itself. 

As they dragged Janique away from the unconscious body of the guard, she gave her one last sharp kick to the ribs.

###

To his credit, his lawyer did make an effort on his behalf, motioning for a mistrial on the spot. It was summarily dismissed by the judge of course, but Chris gained a tiny amount of respect for the man through this action. The trial droned on without Janique, and a thought occurred to him. If it resumed in the morning and continued all day, he wouldn�t be able to blow up the wall. All he could do was wait. Luckily, when the day ended at five, the judge again rescheduled for one the next afternoon.

In the pod, there was nothing to do but wait and worry. He ran through his plans in his head all night, modifying them to accommodate Janique�s situation. Long after midnight, his overstressed brain finally gave in and let him rest. Tomorrow was do or die. 
26 � The Princess & The Outlaw
Chris�s eyes sprang open again at four a.m., and he was awake for what he hoped would be his last day in prison. He had to get to the kitchen, and early.
He worked up a plausible explanation for Earl. Shortly after nine Chris had full access to the food prep areas. As luck would have it, lunch was a ham sandwich and a bowl of highly prized tomato soup. Everyone, to his knowledge, loved that soup. At the first opportunity, he dropped the entire block of heroin into the simmering cauldron. He stuck around for a few minutes and watched it grow steadily darker. If they loved it before, he thought, wait until they try the new and improved formula.

He wasn�t too clear on dosages, but he knew he had put a lot of heroin into it. The problem was one of timing. Most of the prison ate at noon, and Chris wasn�t sure if they�d be sleeping by the time he was due in court. He would make his move either way, he decided. If people were up and about when it was time for court, then he wouldn�t wait for them to nod off before blowing up the wall.

Either way, he had to retrieve Janique, and that part of the plan was to be pure improv.

###

At around eleven, Slim the cook sat down with a small bowl of soup and a cigarette. A long-time heroin addict, he rarely ate solid food. But he loved his tomato soup, actually a bisque, just like everyone else. The first bowl hit him fairly hard. At first, he didn�t make the connection between it and the high he was beginning to feel. After a second bowl, he was convinced. Before he nodded out, he filled a gallon bucket and put it in the walk-in freezer.

###

The rest of the prison population didn�t fare as well as he did, lacking his constitution. What really saved Chris�s plan was the fact that the guards and servers who delivered the food ate afterwards and not before. Otherwise, the entire scheme would have ended there at the kitchen before it began. When the food was finally delivered to the laundry, inspiration struck him. After Jeanette took the meal into her office, and before the girls began to eat theirs, Chris passed near a group of them and said, �I saw the cook spit in the soup,� under his breath.

Word rapidly spread, and only Jeanette ate in the laundry that day. At eleven forty-eight, she put her head down on her desk.

That was all the prompting he needed. He was headed to the outside door in an instant. In the room between the laundry and the main corridor, Chris found what he was looking for. The lone guard assigned there was fast asleep. In a move that shocked him with its brutality, he punched the C.O. in the head, with the vague notion that he might remain unconscious for a while longer. But it was mainly an expression of rage and frustration toward the situation.

This proved to be entirely unfounded as the guard began to stir, and Chris was forced to hit him a second time, harder than the first. It was clear that he didn�t have the luxury of time. He grabbed the guard�s keys, then thought better of it and took his entire uniform, cowboy hat and all. Wearing the outfit made him feel a good deal less vulnerable, and he moved quicker and more decisively as a result. The main corridor was eerily quiet, with none of the accompanying ambient noise ordinarily generated by the inmates and guards.

Chris kicked himself for not making a map of the floor plan on the women�s side the night before and headed off in the direction of what he thought was solitary confinement. The problem of locating Janique was mitigated by the appearance of Amy. He was startled at seeing another guard, but he kept his head down as he passed.

�Hey, where is everyone?� she asked him from less than a foot away.

Chris spun around behind her and put his arm around her throat, jamming his finger into her lower back.

�Take me to solitary,� he growled in her ear.

�You�re a guard,� Amy protested, unable to fathom the possibility that he wasn�t.

�Now,� he said, jabbing her again.

�It�s back this way,� she said, gesturing behind them with her thumb.

Chris turned her around and they started walking. Solitary was less than a hundred feet away, at an intersection he had already passed.

�Here,� she said when they had reached the block where the isolation ward was located.

Chris began fumbling with the key ring on his belt. It must have held twenty or more. After watching him fruitlessly try the first five keys or so and muttering under his breath, �These don�t work,� Amy handed him her set.

�No, those won�t,� she said. �They�re for the men�s side.�

He immediately spied the color-coded key that unlocked the door to the ward, but it opened onto eight cells, each with the window covered from the inside.

�Fuck!� he exclaimed in exasperation.

�Who are you looking for, honey?� Amy asked him, now genuinely interested in helping him.

�Her name is Janique,� Chris said. �She�s kinda petite, redhead��

�I know her. Cell six.�

Chris rushed over and opened the door. There sat Janique with her butt on the floor, her back against the cot, and a thin line of tomato soup running down her chin. She had a huge grin on her face. He grabbed Amy by the wrist and pulled her into the cell with them. �Take off your clothes,� he told her.

Amy blushed, but began to unbutton her top anyway. She could certainly do worse in terms of desirability than the tall and chiseled guard that stood before her. She still hadn�t made the connection that Chris might be a disguised prisoner or wondered why a guard would want to rape her. Instead, he began undressing Janique, who was only half awake, with part of her soup still in the bowl. She came around to a degree when he started to remove her uniform. He had pulled her shirt over her head when she spied the mostly naked Amy shuddering and shivering in front of her.

�Yum,� Janique said languidly.

By then, Amy realized what was to occur, and resigned herself to merely exchanging clothing instead of bodily fluids, and watched Chris undress Janique with interest. When it was all over with, he had a tipsy female guard and a fuming, tied-up prisoner on his hands. It had the makings of a fine porno movie, he thought. He considered gagging her and decided that no one would hear her scream anyway.

�They�re all sleeping,� he told Amy. �They�ll let you out in a few hours.� 

Amy relaxed her posture slightly at this, but still looked somewhere between bewildered and terrified.

�I�m still going to have to lock you in, okay?� Chris asked her. She nodded her head in affirmation.

�C�mon, Jojo,� he told Janique as he threw her over his shoulder.

�Wheee!� she said, and tried to grab her dinner bowl on the way out.

Once Amy was safely interned, he spoke to her through the door. 

�I�d try the soup,� he said, walking away.
27 � The Lovers Reunited
Chris braced himself for some sort of final confrontation before he got back to the laundry, but his fear was unfounded. The trip back was brief and uneventful. He decided he had probably played too many video games growing up. 
Work in the laundry continued unabated. Apparently, other than Jeanette taking a nap, nothing was amiss, and no one even slacked off of their jobs. But it all ended when he walked in with Janique on his shoulder. Girls were pointing and talking about them in an instant, the sight was so unusual. He gave a sharp whistle and got everyone�s attention. 

�The guards and bosses have been knocked out,� he said loudly.

A huge cheer erupted from the laundry workers.

�And if you care to leave,� he said, �that wall will blow up in five minutes. You might want to stay away until you hear the explosion.�

Another cheer arose from the milling girls, now starting to abandon their tasks, but there were also cries of panic. An explosion? Many began to get nervous.

Chris carried Janique into the plumbing chase, pausing only to reach down and grab a flashlight that he had stored for the occasion. He turned left instead of right and deposited his sleeping beauty onto a pallet while he made his final preparations. Back at the make-out room, he pulled out the kitchen timer he�d wired up and spooled the wire out to the end of it, about twenty feet away from the gas valve.

Janique was still curled up on the pallet, but he could see that she had moved, so he tried to wake her up. For the first time since they had been taken to prison, Chris wished he had some speed, just enough to get her up and on her feet. He only had time to wish in one hand, and ran back to the laundry.

�Stay away from the repair room,� he shouted. Girls screamed and ran in all directions.

Back in the chase, Chris drew in a deep breath and threw open the valve. The familiar sound of hissing gas comforted him, until he realized his error and shut it back off. He had built two braces to seal the blast inside the room, and then had forgotten to put them in place. He rushed once again to the love nest and found them standing forgotten behind the door. The rotten egg odor of natural gas already permeated the room. It was going to be a hell of an explosion.

With the braces in place, Chris once again threw open the valve and decided that he wasn�t stopping until they were free. Time stretched out before him, and Janique slept. His determination to break them out caused him to flood the room with gas for a long while. So long, in fact, that he began to smell it all the way down the chase. No time like the present, Chris thought. And then, here goes nothing. He set the timer for thirty seconds, and when it dinged, there was a terrible half second when nothing happened.

Suddenly, the love nest erupted into a ball of fire, accompanied by a deafening explosion. The outside wall of the prison blew out. The laundry lost part of a wall and started to burn. Chris picked up Janique, so sexy in her prison guard outfit, and carried her toward the exit. A huge wall of flames greeted him, partially fueled by the bedding, and preventing their egress. He had left the gas valve open.

�Shit!� he yelled, and ran back with Janique still in his arms. He closed the valve, and back at the former love nest, most of the fire was extinguished except for the burning mattress. A few girls were valiantly attempting to put out the fire, but it was a losing battle.

He stuck his head back into the laundry. �Time to go, girls,� he yelled, and motioned at a few of them with his free hand. �Come on!�

Several of them ran toward him, more out of fear than a desire to escape, and he put them out ahead of him, as a distraction. Hopefully, it would help guarantee them a successful escape. Finally, Chris emerged through the smoke on the outside with Janique in his arms.

The lone guard outside the fence hadn�t eaten the soup, and had opened the gate in an attempt to corral the escaping laundresses. They simply evaded him and laughed, running just out of his reach and through the opening he provided for them. There were just too many to catch, furthermore. He eventually just stood there, shoulders slumped, and watched them run away. Then, instead of getting on the radio as he was trained to do, the guard ran toward the hole in the wall, nearly knocking Chris and Janique down in the process.

At first, Chris thought they were sunk, until he remembered the guard uniforms they wore.

�What the hell?� the guard yelled at the sight of them.

�Gas explosion,� Chris yelled back, �From the construction.�

The guard peered warily into the smoking ruins of the make-out room.

�There�s people hurt in there,� Chris continued. �I�m bringing her to the hospital. I�ll call for backup on the way.�

�Take my truck,� the helpful guard said, handing Chris the keys. Once he had turned to go into the prison, Chris set Janique down on the grass and followed him inside. A few moments later, a cinderblock came down hard on the guard�s head, knocking him unconscious. He dragged him back outside so he wouldn�t die of smoke inhalation.

�No good deed goes unpunished,� he told the sleeping figure as he exited the prison for what he hoped would be the last time. He scooped Janique up off the grass just as she was opening her eyes.

�Tomato� soup,� she croaked in his ear.

�Later,� he told her. �All the soup you want.�

Pleased by this, she shut her eyes and smiled.

The truck was parked next to the guard shack and started with a roar. Chris was instantly in gear, backing up in a wide circle, shooting gravel in every direction. On the road, he turned on the headlights. With any luck, no one would know about the escape for an hour or so, unless someone reported the smoke as a fire. But the prison was isolated, and there wasn�t a lot of it, at least.

He headed for their safehouse. It was a stroke of brilliance on his part. He had bought a distressed duplex, fixed it up, and then leased it back out again. The rate he rented it at insured that the resident, a single Latina mother, would be there for years to come. Inside of her utility closet were he and Janique�s false identities, and a fair amount of cash. 

Chris was almost there when he experienced a brief tinge of panic. He had retrieved items from there before, but he usually wore a maintenance outfit and carried a toolbox. Time for more improv, he thought, and knocked on the door.

�Mrs. Hernandez?� he began when she answered it.

�Yes?�

�I�m sorry, ma�am, but we have a report of a gas leak in the area that we�d like to follow up on.�

�Gas leak?� she asked, concerned.

�Yes, ma�am. The prison has already exploded.�

�Really?� she asked. �I don�t smell any gas.�

�Yes, ma�am. Well, this gas doesn�t have any smell to it, so I have to use a detector. It will only take a minute.�

�Come in, come in,� she urged him.

In the closet, Chris opened the compartment where the air conditioner�s filter went, and then a smaller door hidden inside the ductwork. He took the clothes, money, and I.D.s, but left the weapons in the belief that they wouldn�t be needed. On his way back out to the truck with the items stowed in a paper grocery bag, Chris took pity on the welfare mother and her three fatherless children.

�Do you have a piece of paper?� he asked her. She rapidly produced one.

He scratched out what he felt was a legal deed transfer, signed it, and gave it to her.

�Here,� he said. �Get this notarized, and the apartment is yours.�

�Qu�?� she said, reverting to her mother tongue.

�It�s my house, and I�m giving it to you. A gift.� He searched for the right word. �Un regalo.�

��Es verdad?� she asked in disbelief.

�S�, s�,� he said. �De nada.�

��Gracias, jeffe, gracias!� she was saying as her tears began to flow.

Chris was about to turn and go, and instead reached into the bag and came out with a crumpled fistful of hundreds.

�Here,� he said simply.

The Latina was on him in an instant, arms around his neck, kissing his face. She tried to bring him back inside, no doubt to repay him with the only currency she had. He shook his head no.

�De nada, de nada,� he said again, and opened the truck door.

��Vaya con dios!� she shouted after him. ��Buena suerte!�

Good luck? Chris thought. I�ll need it.

He drove what he felt was a sufficient distance from both the prison and safehouse, and then parked in an alleyway. Janique woke up as he was changing into his street clothes. �Oh, officer,� she said, smiling. But it was a good thing he had changed first. If Janique had awakened to find a cop undressing her, she might well have killed him before she realized her mistake.

�Good morning, moonlight,� he said brightly. �Put these on.�

He handed her a bundle of clothes.

�Where� where are we?� she asked, half-asleep and still stoned.

�Not in prison,� he said. �Now get dressed.�

�But how?�

Chris understood that she was disoriented, but time was of the essence. He grabbed her ankles and pulled, an action that resulted in her head hitting the seat. He pulled off her shoes, then unbuttoned her pants and pulled them off as well, taking her panties with them. 

�Oh, officer!� she repeated with renewed interest. But she was dimly aware that it wasn�t the time or place for that, and so she slowly began to unbutton her shirt. Once they were both dressed, wearing normal clothes for the first time in a year, Chris walked to the street.

�Hey, kid,� he said, tossing the keys to a passing youth. �Want a truck?�

Disbelieving, he tried to give them back, until Chris led him to where Janique was now leaning against it.

�Take some gas money,� Chris said, extending him a hundred-dollar bill.

As the kid sped off, a now fully-awake Janique said, �Well, that was mean.�

Chris shrugged his shoulders.

�Maybe he won�t get caught,� he said. �Either way, it buys us some time.�

Unburdened, the two walked for several blocks and then called a cab from a payphone. An hour after that, Bernard Mickey Wrangle and Princess Leigh Cheri emptied the contents of their safety deposit box, taking Janique�s ring along with several hundred thousand dollars in cash.

###

Finally, they got their own car out of long-term storage. Ready to drive out of state, Chris ran into a convenience store for supplies.

�Why the hell is gas so expensive?� he asked the clerk.

He came back out with an armload of snacks, and handed Janique a Coke, along with a pack of Marlboro Reds.

�No thanks,� she said, accepting the soft drink. 

�What, are you pregnant?� he asked her.

She cuddled up next to him. 

�Ask me in a few hours,� she said, closing her eyes.

Settled in, Chris turned on the tape deck, and the opening riff from �Life in the Fast Lane� began to play.

Janique hit eject and threw the tape into the backseat.

�We need a new theme song,� she said.

�We can get one in Hawaii,� he told her.

And they did.
