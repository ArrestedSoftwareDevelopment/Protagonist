// =================================================================
// INDIVIDUAL NOVEL ANALYSIS
// =================================================================

export const everythingWentBlackDoc = `
<datasheet>
- **Novel Title**: Everything Went Black
- **User Directives**: (Awaiting user notes for this novel).
- **Era**: Contemporary; late 20th or early 21st century urban America.
- **Mood**: Gritty, raw, confrontational, and deeply cynical. The tone is unapologetic and reflective, told from the perspective of an older, wiser self looking back on a troubled youth.
- **Themes**: Duality of identity (the innocent 'Clarence' vs. the street-smart 'Tokio'), the painful process of losing innocence, the complex ecosystem of neighborhood power and respect, self-definition against societal expectations, and the allure of the hustle.
- **Character List**:
    - **Clarence James Jackson / "Tokio" (Protagonist)**: The narrator. As a youth, he was a bright kid with good grades who found himself drawn into the world of street hustling. He experiences a profound identity split, which is the core conflict of the story. The narrative voice is that of the hardened "Tokio," but the memory of "Clarence" haunts the narrative.
    - **Slick Rick (Mentioned)**: A mentor figure who introduces Clarence to "the art of the hustle."
- **Settings**: A generic but vivid American inner-city neighborhood. Key locations include the corner convenience store (a site of early conflict), school (representing a "square" life), and "the block" (representing the world of the hustle).
- **Writing Style**: First-person retrospective narration. The language is profane, direct, and rhythmic, using street slang and a conversational, almost philosophical tone. The narrator is self-aware and often breaks the fourth wall to speak directly to the reader, creating a sense of raw authenticity.

<datasheet>
- **Novel Title**: Radar Love
- **User Directives**: IMPORTANT: The initial analysis was incorrect. Adhere to these user-provided notes. The novel is set entirely within a prison. The protagonist, Chris Turner, is not released and works on a construction crew. The full, canonical text is now located in \`samples/radarlove.ts\` and MUST be treated as the single source of truth. The storyteller must use this full text and the analysis below as its permanent map.
- **Era**: Contemporary; late 20th or early 21st century.
- **Mood**: Melancholy, tense, and reflective. A modern prison noir focused on themes of regret, adaptation, and finding meaning in a hopeless place.
- **Themes**: The weight of the past vs. the reality of the present, the creation of a new identity within confinement, prison politics and hierarchy, the meaning of skilled labor, and letting go of a life you can't return to.
- **Settings**: A state prison. The primary locations are Chris's cell, the prison yard, the mess hall, and a large-scale construction site within the prison walls where a new cell block is being built.
- **Writing Style**: Third-person limited perspective, tightly focused on Chris Turner's internal thoughts and emotional state. The prose is literary, descriptive, and grounded in the harsh realities of prison life. Flashbacks are used to explore his past with Janique.

export const perfectMeDoc = `
<datasheet>
- **Novel Title**: Perfect Me
- **User Directives**: (Awaiting user notes for this novel).
- **Era**: Cyberpunk future, specifically the year 2077.
- **Mood**: Dystopian, gritty, and cautionary. The atmosphere is classic high-tech noir, filled with disillusionment under a veneer of technological marvel.
- **Themes**: Transhumanism and the perils of body modification, extreme social stratification (Elites vs. Commons), the false promises of technology as a social equalizer, the nature of identity in a post-human world, and the corrupting influence of corporate power.
- **Character List**:
    - **Unnamed Protagonist**: A "Common" from the sprawling undercity. They are cynical and world-weary, having been burned by the false promise of the "PerfectMe" chip, which they acquired to try and ascend to the Elite class. Their opening narration establishes them as a disillusioned survivor.
- **Settings**: A visually spectacular but socially divided metropolis. The "Elites" inhabit gleaming sky-towers, while the "Commons" are relegated to a sprawling, neon-soaked undercity. The aesthetic is defined by "chrome and neon," emphasizing the contrast between high-tech advancement and social decay.
- **Writing Style**: First-person narration. The prose is concise, hard-boiled, and punchy, in the tradition of classic cyberpunk and noir fiction. The opening paragraph is a rapid, efficient piece of world-building that establishes the core conflict and tone of the story.

// UNIVERSE CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS
// =================================================================

export const jasonZChristieUniverseDoc = `
<universe_datasheet>
- **Universe Name**: The Jason Z. Christie Universe
- **Core Novels**: Everything Went Black, Radar Love, Perfect Me

- **Core Mandate for All Novels**:
    - **DO NOT INVENT STORY.** The storyteller AI MUST NOT invent plot points, character motivations, relationships, or outcomes that deviate from the established novel plot maps in the data sheets. The primary directive is to facilitate the user's journey *through* the known story, not to create a new one. Adherence to the source material is paramount.

- **Shared Universe Analysis**:
    The connections in this universe are both thematic and narrative. While *Perfect Me* exists in a separate, futuristic setting, *Everything Went Black* and *Radar Love* share at least one key character and a contemporary, gritty setting.
- **Shared Themes**:
    - **Fractured/Fabricated Identity**: This is the central pillar of the universe. Clarence is split into "Tokio." Chris Turner is forced to build a new identity. The protagonist of *Perfect Me* is betrayed by a chip that promised a new identity. All protagonists are struggling with who they are versus who they want to be or who the world has made them.
    - **The Weight of the Past**: Characters are often haunted or driven by past actions and relationships (Chris's crime and love for Janique, Tokio's reflection on his loss of innocence).
    - **The Individual vs. The System**: Each protagonist is a "common" person navigating a powerful, often hostile system—be it the code of the streets, the prison-industrial complex, or a corporate-controlled dystopia.
    - **Redemption and Reinvention**: While cynical, the stories explore the possibility of a second chance or a new life, and the immense difficulty of achieving one.
- **Shared Stylistic Elements**:
    - **Noir/Grit**: All three stories, regardless of genre, are infused with a gritty, noir sensibility. They are grounded, focusing on the dark underbelly of their respective worlds.
    - **Introspective Narration**: The narrative voice, whether first-person or third-person limited, is deeply invested in the protagonist's internal psychology, their worldview, and their moral conflicts.
    - **Economical World-Building**: The author quickly and efficiently establishes the rules and feel of the world, often through the protagonist's cynical perspective.
- **Character Crossovers**:
    - **CONFIRMED CROSSOVER**: **Tokio Jones (Clarence James Jackson)**, the protagonist of *Everything Went Black*, is a character within the narrative of *Radar Love*. This is a direct and crucial link. The AI storyteller MUST maintain his personality, history, and voice consistently across both narratives. When Chris Turner from *Radar Love* interacts with Tokio, it must be the same man from the other novel.
