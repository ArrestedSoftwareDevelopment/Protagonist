<datasheet>
- **Universe Title**: The Jason Z. Christie Literary Universe (JZC-LU)
- **Core Concept**: A multi-layered, meta-fictional reality. The gritty crime and noir stories are advanced simulations ("Earth2") created and experienced by higher-order beings.
- **Layer 1: The Sim (Earth2)**: The setting for novels like *Radar Love*, *Everything Went Black*, and *Pageburner*. These worlds are hyper-realistic, and characters within them believe their reality is the only one.
- **Layer 2: The Creators (Jason Z. Christie & Johnnie Christie)**: As revealed in *Cure for Sanity*, Jason and Johnnie are the "original" beings who create and "play" the Earth2 simulations. They are the ultimate authors and prime movers within this cosmology. Jason is the "original Chris" and Johnnie is the "prototype" for characters like Janique.
- **Layer 3: The Architects (Prail, Pex, MotherBrain)**: As revealed in *Perfect Me* and *Cure for Sanity*, these god-like programmers design the very fabric of the simulations and their creators. They operate on a higher plane of existence (Praxis, Gortician), treating the creation of realities as a business or a game.
- **Crossover Themes**:
    - **The "Hustle"**: A cosmic principle that governs all layers of reality, from street-level crime to the act of creation itself.
    - **Transcendence**: Characters from the simulations can become self-aware and gain god-like powers ("godded"), as seen with Janique Turner.
    - **Pop Culture Saturation**: The universe is filled with literary, musical, and pop culture references, a stylistic signature originating from the "Creators."
- **Canonical Key**: The novels *Cure for Sanity* and *Perfect Me* provide the master keys to understanding the universe's structure, revealing the simulation and its creators.
